"Overdose A few hours ago I wasn't really in control of myself and I ended up swallowing 7 times my normal dosage of Prozac, it's been 5 hours after sleeping and my body is starting to feel Ill, I've now starting to vomit. What should I do?"	sw
"Do you like yourself? ""Love yourself so much as much as you want to be loved."" I know that I should do this but there are just times that I really can't. I think there are more things that I don't like a bout myself than the thinks I like. First, physically, I don't really like how I look sometimes. I can't really say that I'm ugly it's just that I'm bigger and look more mature than other girls of my age. I know I can change it by exercising and eating the right foods but you know, it's just so hard to be trapped in a sluggish body that likes eating. I know it's just a matter of self-discipline and I really need to practice this more. That's also one of the things I don't like about me. I'm lacking self-discipline, too sensitive and emotional, over-thinker, quick-tempered and cry easily. I also don't trust myself regarding my decisions in life. There are a lot of things that I find unlovable about myself and it gets worse when I hear what people says about me.  I read from somewhere these lines: ""Sometimes, we need someone to accept us and love us first. Then, we would learn to see ourselves through that person's eyes and learn to love ourselves.""... Maybe it's like that. Maybe it would be so much easier to love myself when I met that someone who love me as I am.     But of course, I still want to give my self a pat on the back for trying my best everyday.  I still want to try to love myself more. After all, Me, myself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve my love and affection."	cc
"I gave up Reddit for Lent, and this is what I learned For the last couple years or so, I've been active on Reddit almost every day. Gradually, Reddit became the only thing I did for fun on my phone. I've never been that into games, and I've abandoned most other social apps. And I don't regret that. Reddit is awesome. But it became a source of daily comfort for me, and therefore when it came time to give something up for Lent, it just made sense. My wife and I aren't particularly religious, but we decided to do Lent this year as an exercise in self control. So I deleted the Reddit app off my phone and removed it from my Chrome bookmarks, and beyond a thread popping up in the odd Google search, I haven't read a word of Reddit content for the last 47 days. And here is what the experience has taught me:  1. Facebook is a BUMMER. If you want to be pissed off at the world, irritated at people you like, and annoyed by irrelevant ads, go to Facebook. But without Reddit to kill those small increments of time we spend waiting for things, I turned to this old standby. Facebook has sucked for a long time, but I keep it for other people's sake. Most of the older generation of my family can barely stomach the idea of Facebook, and to them switching to something else is about like switching from cars to rocket ships as their primary means of transportation. They had a hard enough time switching to Facebook from their hand-written address books. I love these people, and I want to stay in touch with them, and I cannot in good conscience ask them to abandon the fragile comfort they've found in the digital age. So when it comes to sharing pics and videos of my daughter, a private Facebook group allows everyone to participate. But for me, as a way of killing 5-10 minutes, Facebook is about equal to self-flagellation.  2. I miss reading books. Without social media to kill time, I turned to ebooks. I discovered that Google's Play Books app is actually really powerful, and the Play Store has a huge library of classic books for bargain prices. I stocked up on a bunch of bucket list items, and even dove into a few heady volumes that have been on my shelves for a while. For the first time in years, I'm actively reading 5 books. I've always been one of those multiple-books-at-once people, but in the past couple years Reddit usurped that reading time. I like to have different books for different reading spots: one for each bathroom in my house, and one for bedtime. And I like to have different ebooks for different spans of time. If I have 5 minutes to kill, I'll page through a comic book. If I have an hour or more, I'll read Plato or Proust. Over the last 47 days I've rediscovered my interest in reading, and I was surprised to find I didn't miss the stuff I read on Reddit at all. Which leads me to the next thing I learned.  3. What I miss about Reddit is having a place to post things. I'm not particularly witty, and I don't really have a strong need for attention, but every now and then I will happen to come up with a meme, or shower thought, or discussion topic that my Facebook friends might not get, but that the wider internet would probably like. And Facebook is a terrible place to post that kind of stuff. It won't appear in most of your friends' feeds, and the ones who see it will either ignore it, or they won't understand it, and will post some awkward comment forcing you to explain your joke/reference, and the whole thing becomes exhausting. This post is a perfect example. Most of my Facebook friends don't even know what Reddit is, so they wouldn't understand. And virtually none of them would bother reading a post of this length.  4. The other thing I miss about Reddit is those rare, valuable moments where you really make a connection with someone. This is one of those areas where the anonymity of Reddit really works in your favor. Here, people are much more bold with the things they're willing to discuss because the social consequences of vulnerability are virtually non-existent. I follow a few support-group-ish subs, and on more than one occasion I've been able to jump straight into a deep conversation without all the awkwardness and small talk that gets in the way in real life. Even online, when you're talking to people you know, every relationship has baggage that prevents you from getting real with people. Here you can skip that. Don't get me wrong, Reddit is still 99% mental junk food. Hell, the whole internet is. But at least here there aren't any built in barriers to deep conversation.  So now that it's Easter, I'm back. And I'll probably still use Reddit every day. But it's not going to be like it was. The mindless content browsing? I didn't miss that at all. If I have 5 mins to kill, maybe. But any more time than that, and I'd rather be reading. And when I'm here, I'm going to try to focus on more meaningful interactions. I'll probably never have a life completely free of mental junk food, but I've learned that I never really liked it as much as I thought I did."	cc
"What's the best road trip (or trips, if you can't decide) you've ever been on? I shared mine within Hi guys!  I'm feeling like reminiscing and I welcome you all to join me. I'd love to hear about all of your greatest adventures on the roads of the world.  And spare no details :D  My favorite roadtrip is between one of these three:  1. Chicago to Portland, through Canada. We went up to Bemidji State Park in Minnesota in ten hours, made camp and canoed the next day. Then we were at Winnipeg, Manitoba, and I played drums at a really cool blues jam. Then we crossed the continent, and during that time was probably the most at peace I've ever been in my life, driving over the Continental Divide. When we hit Banff, we were floored at how beautiful it was. We spent three days camping in different places around there, went to a party in Vancouver, and then hung out in Portland for five days being ents and playing more music.  2. All the same guys on the first one swam in every single great lake in 8 days. We went Chicago, Minneapolis, Thunder Bay, and then 2 days of camping, Toronto, and then we played a house party in Niagara. That was amazing.  How about you all?"	cc

"I’m Considering Killing Myself Tomorrow I go to a school right by the interstate. It would be easy for me to sneak out, run up the exit ramp, and jump in front of a truck.  Nobody I know really cares about me. All the people I know at school couldn’t care less, even my friends, about me. My extended family hates me, and my father’s been dead for years, with my mother just barely taking time to interact with me.  I am terrible at everything I try to do. I’m supposedly good at math, but I can’t really do it. I have terrible memory, and I have little to no social skills.  Since I was nine I’ve wished I didn’t exist. Now, at thirteen, I have a death wish. For the past two months, I have had suicidal thoughts, ranging from jumping off of a building, to strangling myself, and I settled on this.    I don’t know if I’ll go through with it, but I don’t have much to live for. I’ve considered trying to get to see a therapist, but I think that will only prolong the inevitable.  Please don’t tell me to contact a hotline, because I did that. They didn’t help much.  I also generally just hate life. I didn’t choose to be born, but here I am.  Edit: I’m giving myself until Friday, because I need a plan, but also in case I don’t want to do it in the end."	sw

"don't see a way out from beneath my credit card debt I've buried myself under a mountain of $40,000 in credit card debt. It's no one's fault but mine. I did it to myself with my own bad decisions. And I don't see a way out. I feel totally hopeless. I can't enjoy life anymore. I work several jobs and the hole keeps getting deeper with most of my sizeable monthly payments going to interest. I'm constantly exhausted with nothing but a bigger pile of debt to show for it. I feel like I deserve to be culled from the herd. "	sw
"I got a bottle of Whiskey now all I need is to find the right time. I'm not a big guy, 5'6"". Could be wrong but I figure an entire bottle of 40% vol whiskey should be enough. I can't do it while my family are around at home and I can't do it while my housemates are around in college.  Right now I'm just waiting until I've got a good 12 or so hours to myself. I figure after a while my body will start rejecting it, I don't know how I'll keep it all down. It'll take some time but if I can get the full bottle down I figure that'll do it."	sw
"My Random Past Time For a few years now, probably about 3 years; I (F) have read stories to help people sleep. It started by accident. Ever since that one individual (I didn't know them, I just found them online.) asked me to read to them, I had done it ever since. Since I suffer with insomnia, I thought why not make use of my time.   I would make a post online and wait. On average each night I would read to about 3-5 people until they fell asleep. I was able to do more if I had enough time that night. On average, it took about 15 minutes or less for people to fall asleep. I enjoyed reading and these people and they enjoyed being read too, needless to say it was a win win.   As I got older, I decided to diversify and start sending goodnight messages to those who wanted one (voice messages). This proved to be quite popular, it wasn't until a few months later that I realised how much some people really appreciated a 30 second message wishing them goodnight.   After doing this for several months I began to get ""regulars"" I didn't mind and we managed to find a schedule that suited nearly everyone. I enjoyed reading to these people, even though I did receive a lot of perverted messages based on my voice. That's what the block feature was there for! :) My enjoyment went down hill after some began to become rather obsessive/a tad possessive. Any who, I digress...  That was my random past time. Do you have any unusual hobbies? If so, what are they? "	cc
I keep saying that I want to kill myself but I know I'm not going to actually do it I've been really feeling crappy about my life in general. I just don't know how to climb out of the hole I'm in. I'm seeing a therapist about my ADHD and depression but I'm really scared to tell him about these thoughts because I feel like I'm going to get myself involuntarily committed. I know I'm not going to kill myself but the sentiment and ill feelings are real.  I'm trying to take life one day at a time but it's really hard to see beyond what's in front of me right now.	sw
"Pissssed off and suicidal Im pretty depressed cuz I have no friends and am a senior in highschool. No girlfriend (in fact I havent been with one ever) and really nothing to do with myself other than lift weights and do my work or play a video game. I've had this strong sort of hate towards the mainstream and hate all the trends that have circled around, I'm sure you know what I'm on about. I'm talking about the shit heads that smoke Juuls and listen to trap music or anything that's bound to get old quick(Drake). I'm a metal head, and I grew up in a town with no one else who shares that. I love Pantera, or some Slayer and not the bullshit people listen to now.   ANNNYYYWAY The reason why I'm depressed is because I've never found that group that I fit in with. All of my previous friends left me because they wanted to smoke and drink and use people for their money. Fucked, am I right? I feel like shit for not going to parties or being with a girl at least once. Shit pisses me off that I live in this place, especially when I'm in a town where every one is preppy. So I'm not going to give you ALL the details but I'm sure you know what's good so what are your thoughts of this and what the fuck should I do to improve on myself because I'm tired of being alone and I can't do much about it since I hate a lot of people in my town. I just don't know where I belong.  Thank you"	sw
"I'm not particularly good at anything and feel like I should kill myself I've struggled with suicide ideation for several years and sometimes would come close but never actually go through with it. I think about it almost constantly though. One of the driving factors is that while my best skill is art, I'm still not particularly good at it and have no skills in anything else. Failing at that would leave no other career options for me and I'd be basically proving to my family and friends who already have no faith in my choice that they were right all along and I'm a failure.  I really feel like nobody would miss me all that much if I were gone. I study animation (which I wholly regret) and none of my peers like me at all. I live in California and when the wildfires were going on, I was in class and received an alert that one had happened close to my home. I panicked a little and said aloud I might need to stay at a friend's place if something happened, and a fairly popular classmate who'd overheard my situation completely didn't care and told me not to call ahead be rude and imposing on someone else. In the same breath he'd called me wasteful for not finishing my snack. It seems like such a small thing to be fixated on but I feel like my other classmates feel the same way about me. Even my own friends don't really care about my work—they've promoted and commission other friends but just kind of ignore mine and one even admitted she never thought very highly of it. I've abandoned a friend group recently because I found out several guys in that group were stalking and sexually harassing another close friend of mine and nobody else wanted to speak up against it. As a result I don't really have a university life outside of my school or boyfriend anymore and I feel like a loser.  I feel like I'm just such a fundamentally unlikeable and untalented person and with nothing positive to offer the world and there's really nothing left for me and people would move on quickly if I were gone.

"BookCon (#92) ^^^^I ^^^^spent ^^^^0% ^^^^of ^^^^my ^^^^spring ^^^^break ^^^^doing ^^^^any ^^^^of ^^^^the ^^^^school ^^^^work ^^^^I ^^^^needed ^^^^to. ^^^^Oh ^^^^I ^^^^cannot ^^^^wait ^^^^for ^^^^graduation  Last year on the first weekend of June I went to an event called [BookCon](http://www.thebookcon.com/). It was exactly what it sounds like, a convention for books, readers, and authors. I went solo because I like getting books by myself and I figured I'd be able to see more of what I wanted to without having to appeal to someone else's tastes. It was an all right experience. I got a good amount of books, a few were signed by the authors standing there and 1 or 2 were free. As far as I know, there really weren't any big names there unless you went to the meet and greet area but when I looked at that list I didn't see anybody who I had actually read before (and only a very small handful of names I recognized despite working in a library for four years) so I didn't bother waiting in line for any of those. There were also some panels going on and I went to two, one about sci-fi and incorporating politics into the fictional worlds; it wasn't as interesting to me as I thought it was gonna be. And the other was about how much of an impact the rise in the YA subgenre is having on teens and reading and it was actually more interesting than I thought it was gonna be. I gave the day overall maybe a 7 outta 10 because I was expecting more than what I got. But that didn't put me off from never going again.  I just remembered the other day the BookCon should be coming up in June so I looked online at the list of panels and oh my goodness I'm actually overwhelmed by all the panels that seem interesting. I'm planning on going to the Saturday of the convention because all the panels I am interested fall on that day; but the problem is there are a few that fall at the same or similar times as each other and I have to choose what I am most interested in attending.  To start off, from 9-11am I have to decide if I want to attend the Sci-fi and Fantasy writing workshop or the fiction writing workshop. Both of these cost extra (but are the same price) unlike the rest of the panels and I am interested in both. I am more used to writing plain fiction and I think I would have an easier time writing samples from the prompts given there; but I also really enjoy reading sci-fi/fantasy and yet I never write it because, well a bunch of reasons. That workshop claims it'll help focus on ""how to combine mind-bending world-building with a powerful narrative drive"" (quoted from the website). So I have to figure out which I want to attend more.  Then there is a panel called When Reality is Stranger Than Fiction that is from 10:30-11:15 which interrupts both the writing workshop session but it sounds kinda cool about how thriller/mystery writers are basically competing with grasping audiences when what is going on in the news is more compelling than made up events. I think though that if I have to miss this panel for the workshops I wont be too disappointed.   The next panel that sounds interesting is from 11-11:50am and that is called Horror! Thrills! Murder! Oh My! And it is about building suspense in writing across genres. It sounds pretty cool and I'm sure I could catch most of it after the writing workshop I attend.  A few other panels go on but none that really catch my eye again until around 12:45-1:30pm where a panel that discusses world building and how to make that interesting is going on (this time with one author who I recognize but never read before). I think learning from that would be cool.   The next panel that interests me is called Magic and Power at 3:45-4:45pm has a bunch of authors that I recognize but again haven't read and it's talking about fantasy books and how magic/power affects the struggles their characters face and stuff like that.  The last panel that I am interested in is called Into the Booth: A Glimpse Into Audiobooks at 4:45-5:30pm. I've never listened to an audiobook but my real dream job has always been to be an audio engineer in a recording studio so it'll be cool to sit in on that and just learn about how recordings for books are made.   There were a few other panels that looked like they might be interesting but not enough for me to really go. This gives me a jam packed day of learning cool things about books and writing and in the down time I'll maybe have between panel sessions I can walk around the showroom floor and get books, meet authors (and hopefully this time be a bit more talkative with them, cause I had no idea what to talk about with any of them last year), and just enjoy being around other book lovers. The Sunday panels I am sure are also interesting, but when I looked at them they didn't stand out as much as all the ones I mentioned here did.  I remember one of my coworkers thought the idea of BookCon was lame but he goes to ComicCon almost every year so who is the real nerd here? I'll be sure to tell him I'm going to BookCon again this year whenever we work together again.  Have you ever been to a convention for anything before?  Would learning about different elements of writing, like those mentioned in the panels I want to attend, interest you?  Are you someone who enjoys reading books? If so, what kind?

I’m in college, but I’m doing rather poorly. Right now I have no money for gas to make it to school, it’s a 50 minutes drive and my car only gets 17 to the gallon.    Another thing is my boyfriend, we’ve been together for a few months shy of a year. Friday we celebrated his 20th birthday and we got drunk (including his parents). He started saying horrible things about me, he called me suicide watch and started going on about how bad my mental health was. I had to brush it off and pretend it didn’t happen because his parents were there. I talked to him about it the next morning, he felt bad but that doesn’t deflect the fact he did it.   I’m just 18, I have no family nor a stable home. No money for food or gas, no one to help me live. I start a job at Walmart sometime next week and I know that’s going to take a toll on me as well.

"All you 'Car' people: How do you do it? I'm just now starting down the road of working on my first hobby car, and it seems like every answer isn't just year/make/model plug-and-play, but also a maze of different interchangeable parts that only seems navigable by wizardry sorted by a numbering system that itself requires a certain expertise to understand.

"Lost the only source of joy in my life yesterday Last night I was kicked from the community orchestra I've been a part of since september last year.   The entire duration of my time with them, I carpooled with a girl and we became good friends. Last weekend we had a huge performance at a convention. The night of Friday, after a long day of con and a rehearsal that went until 11pm, I opened up to her about my frustrations in life. She seemed to empathize and then under the context of another topic, it came out that she had broken up with her boyfriend weeks ago. Up to this point, I had firmly respected her boundaries to remain just friends, but immediately after this revelation I found myself considering the idea of asking her out. I'm only human.  On Sunday, I was prepared to give her a plushie of her favorite pokemon and ask her out after our performance. Before I could, she was informed that her friend had managed to get her a job interview that same day, so I kept quiet so as not to add to the things on her mind. The next day, I sent her a couple fb msgs asking to meet up. No response. I was prepared to write it off as her being busy, but then she started talking in the orchestra's group chat, while the sign next to my message remained delivered but not read. Clearly she was ghosting me, and I am still bewildered as to why. We had a great time at the con. Sure I may have been the stereotypical nice guy for driving her around, but I always made her laugh with jokes and kept the social awkwardness to a minimum with the rest of the group.  So the next day, Tue, after still no response, I assumed she was upset with me and asked one of her friends if she knew why. Well the friend was unhelpful but must have prompted carpool girl to respond because she did, trying to reassure me that nothing was wrong. Problem was I could sense passive aggressiveness in her writing, which stuck out immediately because she had always been polite, if not sweet, with me. I tried to call her out on it, because it seemed at the time that's what a self-respecting man should do. Well now I know I should have let her have her space or just gave up on her.  On Wed, she actually had a brief exchange with me. I tried to make my worries about her known in a humorous way, but probably came across resentful.  I think the situation might still have been salvaged at this point, with me retaining my place in the orchestra if not repairing my relationship with carpool girl. Well, I threw it all away last night. My friend, who recently landed a job, invited me out for drinks to celebrate. He knew I was feeling down too. What a great guy. Well I got way more drunk than I've ever been and sent a few pitiful texts. When I got home, our conductor had messaged me on fb warning me that she had received complaints of harassment. Normally I would have probably taken a step back and reined myself in. Well drunk me decided sending a few nasty messages accusing carpool girl was the right course of action. And almost immediately, conductor replied back that that constituted repeat offense, so I was out of the group.  Anyway thanks to anyone who read this far. It is already helping with my thoughts to have my side of the story out, even if you're complete strangers. God knows how they are maligning my name at this very moment. Certainly I'm not innocent, but I just know there's no one in the group who feels a shred of sympathy for me. I had been having near constant dark thoughts today, and I feel like the painful reality won't even set in until the day of their next rehearsal. Fuck I'm so mad at myself."	sw
Reddit is fantastic I have joined years ago but never had an interest in spending on Reddit since I joined and didn't have an idea about the platform but recently I came back to this platform again and found subreddits with variety of subjects and awesome people rising options. I still don't know much about the platform but enjoying going through communities. I spend most of times on FB but now I just found this platform really interesting. 	cc
"I'm concerned about an ex, but most think they're cries for attention I have an ex from a relationship that lasted from high school past college. He was a good boyfriend in the sense that he was supportive and never abusive or unkind toward me. Obviously we both changed much throughout that time and devolved into friendship. Mostly I could not tolerate his seemingly outsized anger.  His family life was not ideal. His father was a domineering man, short of stature but not the stereotypical desire to live at the gym and judge his sons, sometimes violently, by their athletic prowess. Try as he might, the ex and his older brother did not excel in sports. Their father's anger was physically exercised on the eldest, the psychological abuse was saved for my ex. Catholic school, rod-rotting nuns and all, coupled with a meek, spineless mother added a misogyny bent to the equation. Watching friends and his brother die in high school from overdoses compounded the pain, depression, and anger.   I offer this brief background in the hopes it might clarify some of who he is. I'm aware armchair diagnoses are professionally unethical, but I'm truly afraid for his safety and others. Since we ended our relationship, I've attempted to remain friends. However the only communications I receive from him are pictures of girls he's having sex with, usually in some degrading form of bondage, or messages conveying his desperate desire to end his own life. Oddly his sexual proclivities seem to contradict his deeply held desire not to die while his mother is alive, lest she suffer the death of another child.  Actually, it's death of other children that scares me the most. While he's never expressed a fondness for firearms beyond a deep devotion for Call of Duty, he has unabashedly shown hatred for and said terrible things about children in general. He's said, ""Fuck your kids,"" to me specifically. These sentiments coupled with his suicidality really concern me. But should I be? Is he just working me? Thank you to anyone who's taken their time to wade through this.   TL;DR Is my sadistic, somewhat misogynistic ex looking for sympathy with his threats of suicide (which are mitigated with his hatred for children and sending degrading sexual photos to unwilling exes) or should I genuinely worry he might shot himself or a classroom first?"	sw
"I fucking love cleaning. No one taught me cleaning or hygiene as a kid. I never knew anything other than absolute filth. It's suffocating to be swarmed with all the filth you've been around for the last several years, never cleaned.  Cleaning is a breath of fresh air. Something I do for me and me alone. It calms me down, it lets me breathe, it keeps all the clutter away and helps me look around and think ""My life is a mess but god damn my bedroom looks nice."".  Little compares to the comfort of laying down in a well made bed at night.   It's so nice to look around and know chores are totally done. I don't have to do anything else I don't want to for the rest of the day.  It's so fucking nice to know I'm not a total slob.  Anyone else just fucking love cleaning?"	cc

"my mind is made up i sit here at 12:47am, typing my bullshit feelings out to complete strangers who do not know me...then again, does anyone?  i’m seventeen years old, a girl from england who has already made plans to kill herself within the next couple of days. i don’t have a particular trigger or event that caused me to feel this way, it’s just how fucked up i am. my anxiety and depression have lead me down a dark route that i’ve given up fighting my way out of.  i’ve felt hopeless for as long as i can remember, even as a child with a great family. i am the problem not them.  i attempted suicide at fourteen, clearly unsuccessful, where i was frowned upon by the organisations meant to help me. “she didn’t know what she was doing” they said. no, because every fourteen year old swallows a ton of pills as if they won’t know the consequences.  i feel that there is no helping me.  i’m a closed book and my story is finished.  i came here because i cannot be open with anybody in person, but please don’t try to convince me not to take my own life because there is honestly no changing my mind."	sw

"Help. I’m lewis. I’m 19. Recently I’ve been having a really tough time. I do graphic design for makeup companies and it gets very stressful at times. It’s been going downhill because of my ever deteriorating mental health (generalised anxiety, bipolar 2, ADD) these health issues also have been what I feel the cause to my mum and stepdad splitting up (my real dad died in a motorbike crash when I was 2) the majority of my friends all moved off to University and I’ve been left to fend for myself, none of them reply to texts or pick up my calls they all seem to be too ‘busy’ dispite one friend however he cannot constantly be my wall to sit on. I’ve been sat on a waiting list to see a therapist for months and it’s getting nowhere. Lately I feel like I’ve been spiralling down, getting into drugs (weed, xanax, coke, mdma) essentially whatever will give me a quick up to feel better. This however I know is not a solution but will just create more issues in the future. My panic attacks have got ever worse over the past few month and I can no longer control them as my prescription for Diazepam hat I used to calm myself was taken off me as the doctors found out I was abusing it. My mums recently gone into hospital for major surgery and is never available to talk to me, I spend most of my time at home on my computer doing artwork that no one appreciates.

"I have an interview tomorrow, any tips for me?! Hi all!  So I’ve been working at my current position for a little over a year and half. I’m in a leadership role on second shift.

"My Experience Being Suicidal I developed my depression when my social anxiety got out of control. All my life, I've struggled with anxiety. Even back when I  was extremely young, I struggled to make friends and attend a public school. My anxiety got so bad to the point where it made me physically sick, and I'd usually end up vomiting every morning. I lost immense amounts of weight this way.  One high school hit, it developed out of control. Being in a school with over 3000 other teenagers was too much for me to bear. I got sick every day, I missed classes and eventually just couldn't show up.  My doctor told me the best option for me was to go on a hospital homebound program until my anxiety was under control. I started on new medications and meeting with new therapists. Many of which helped me for quite awhile.  When I left public school, I lost contact with most of my friends. I felt isolated from my family, my friends, and those whom I cared deeply about. Both my parents worked all day and came home late, my mother was also an alcoholic and drug abuser at the time, even though I didn't know it, and my older brother wanted nothing to do with me. I was alone, all day, every day.  Eventually, I felt so isolated, alone and sad for so long that I couldn't remember whom I once was. I couldn't remember a time where I didn't feel sad, I forgot how I used to act. The things I once enjoyed doing no longer brought me happiness.   I stopped caring about everything. My grades slowly starting slipping, as I was not motivated and didn't care enough to worry about them.  I planned to end my life.  I was a disappointment to my parents. I never felt like I was enough, I would end up starving myself to be skinnier and occasionally throwing up my meals because I worried about gaining weight. I felt as if I had no one, I was alone. I cut myself.  What was the point in living if you can't share a life with others? What was the point in living if you were always alone, always living a life on repeat, never feeling any different?  I cried until there were no tears left, until I was numb. I had watched a movie about a girl who attempted suicide one day when I was alone. That day, I planned to kill myself. I cried and my nose bled, but I didn't bother dealing with it. I sat in a puddle of my own blood and stared at a wall for what felt like hours. I was so mind-numbingly afraid. I said goodbye to the one person who seemed to care about me, the girl who to this day I owe everything to. She begged me not to do it. She called me and messaged me begging me not to go.  I had a handful of prescription pills, and I put them in my mouth. I had researched earlier to see how much I needed to kill myself, and I had the right amount. I held those pills in my mouth, covered in my own blood, shaking, crying and screaming while my friend was messaging and calling me like crazy.   I ended up swallowing some of the pills, not enough to kill myself though. I pushed myself to get up and clean myself up. If I couldn't continue living for myself, I have to continue living for her. I cleaned everything up and once everyone came home that night, it was if nothing happened.  I still feel the urge constantly to end my own life. I still don't know who I am or who I used to be. I'm still alone and isolated. I still cut myself. I'm still hurting and scared, but I'm still here. I'm not too sure why, either. And I'm not too sure how much longer I'll be here because one of these days, I'm going to be brave enough to do it."	sw
"The pain of existence So I've been looking for a place to vent. I don't feel like I'm in immediate danger but at the same time I do.   I don't know where to start so I'm just going to start venting. I am 25 and have battled with depression for most of my adult life. I would say a huge factor in this is my father. He's a good person and loves me I know, but he has his own demons. There is a very personal past with my grandfather that gave him his own issues mostly anger. This led me to spend most of my pubescent time doing what my dad wanted me to do. Spending time with him, trying to make him happy, trying to keep him from getting angry. I think the main result of this was at the time I should have been developing social skills I wasn't. This left me with crippling social anxiety and I have no true friends and I often feel I have no clue how to communicate, especially with the opposite sex. I'm extremely extremely lonely. There is much more to this but I don't want to get too personal in public. This started me down my path.   Couple this with the fact that when was 21 I was diagnosed with a chronic back condition. While we were diagnosing this and figuring out what treatment works for me I spent months in bed and slipped into a deep depression that i spent years ignoring. I spent some of this time contemplating suicide very seriously just to escape the pain. Eventually we were able to control the pain but the depression stayed.   Fast forward to last year bad I finally sought help for the depression and anxiety issues I have been having. I have been fighting for every inch of progress and I feel like I have a mountain left to climb. I still battle with a certain disregard for whether I wake up in the morning if not actively suicidal.   Now I have had a massive resurgence of back pain that hasn't responded to treatment and I am spending 24 hours a day in near unbearable pain. I don't want to live if this is what existence is going to be like. The pain has consumed my mind and I can't help but pause for a second every time I see a viable way to stop the pain. The pain has become everything I am, consumed me and my mind. All I can think about is ending this pain. The loneliness, the emotional pain, and the physical.   I have no fight left. I have lost all will and energy to resist and I'm scared of what every passing hour of pain is bringing me closer to. I've admitted that I will be alone forever and I'm afraid I will be in pain forever. I don't want all that pain to last for another 50 years. I enjoy nothing and have no one. I love to go be miserable and in pain in a shitty job just so I can barely scrape by. Overcoming my lack of courage will be my final act. It's just a matter of how long I last.   "	sw

"I was just reading a text I sent to a friend telling him I was going to commit suicide (Sorry for the mess, I can't seem to organise my thoughts)  Its so weird how everyone reacts in the same way along the lines of ""people will miss you"" ""people care about you"" ""I care"" blah blah blah but it lasts for such a short amount of time...I'm curious as to whether they care. The only time people seem to give 2 shits about me is when I express my suicidal tenancies or show how miserable I am (i'm reluctant at saying i'm depressed since I don't really fully believe in self-diagnosing). before telling them they literally show no signs of caring about me or even attempting to talk with me, I always have to be the one.   I find it hard to believe anyone cares, only 1 person in my life ever made genuine effort in my friendship with them and I had to push them away because they of the toxicity they caused in my life. No one ever reaches out to me, no one ever starts convos with me, i'm never going to be anyone's first. If I were to stop starting conversations with people or assert myself in social situations (like ""oh can i come??"") I will surely be forgotten and pushed aside, in fact its actually true.   I also find it bizarre how my friends just seem to have what feels like...forgotten me... When you tell someone you're suicidal you get gushes, ""you matter/I care"" kind of talk...but that literally only lasted a day?? ""i'll take you to the university counselor!"" lmao I had to walk myself there since they all seemed to forget their promises, not exactly a surprise tbh. The only reason I went is because of them really..I wouldn't have went if it weren't for the fact many of them kind of made me promise I would seek help   I expected a different reaction I suppose, maybe a desperate attempt of feeling loved and receiving care...I feel a bit manipulative and guilty which makes me feel even worst but I really just want to feel loved and I want to know that there's at least someone who gives a shit about me.  I usually never tell people how I feel or about the fact i'm suicidal I keep it to myself because I tell myself people won't care...and I guess I was right."	sw

Help I've been stress vomiting lately. About 7 times over the last few weeks. I'm pretty sure I had this weird sort of hypomanic thing that was off and on for two weeks and doesn't really fit criteria in length and consistency especially since people didn't notice and I'm fucked. I have my final exam for my incomplete this Friday. It was already extended but I'm a fuck up and have made no progress in my essay or notes. I also fell further behind in my other classes. I really would like to self harm and I've noticed myself telling myself that if it all goes to hell I can try killing myself. Idk if that's just now a fucked up coping mechanism or... i can't do this. My therapist hasn't been much help.  Right now my thoughts aren't too serious but I know from prior experience that I can go from not too serious to really bad and writing notes and holding stuff.	sw

"Trying to come up with ideas for my Rap Album...I am not generally a fan of modern rap, so I decided to give an alternate take on the genre...

"Just an existential, life conversation Please include your thoughts and deepest contemplations. Are we merely fish out of water, jumping out of an ocean of complete nothingness, something even less than deep sleep, or do we have incorporeal souls that have some type of inertia or momentum of energy? Are we ‘pure awareness’ without birth or death, or is “this it, coyote.” Can there be awareness without perception and subsequently awareness without an instrument of consciousness, such as a body? What would ‘pure awareness’ be if there were no experiential confirmation of knowing and being? It’s like this question plagues my entire existence but it really doesn’t. I still play my video games, take my walks, go to work, etc. If I had a greatest wish it would be that forever and always, timelessly, everything would increasingly become more and more prosperous and awesome and clear as to what the fuck all of this is. Like why have existence, why is all of this here, if it isn’t always the epitome and seen as the epitome of ultimate ascension and beauty and brilliance and magnificence and peace and awesomeness by all beings, always? I feel like my soul, if there is to be as such, comes out of nothingness through the Universe and is up to the surface in entirety. It is of love and only wants the best, whatever truly best means. There seems to be a barrier of unknowing, where there’s no choice, complete uncertainty."	cc

"I'm tired of myself Hi dear SuicideWatch fellow users, Where to start? Hmm. Not easy. Maybe the fact that I am legally a grown man but I have to endure living with an infant's penis. Before you start saying ""size doesn't matter"" here's my measurements: fully erect 1 inch wide and maybe 4 inches of length. At his normal shape it's usually smaller than the ones of some kids, I'm not joking. It evens looks like I have only one testicle. It's only perceivable I have a pair at really, really, hot days. Inherently, my confidence is affected at so many levels I can say I'm extremely anxious because of it. I ""can't"" beg for help because I don't want to tell or show to someone the main origin of all my problems. I avoid having relations or interactions with ""unknown"" women as I feel immediately embarrassed and cause I know I'll live forever with an handicap, basically a female repellent. I'm studying, the university tuition is high as hell, I'm attempting this for the 2nd time, but, again, I feel I'm a waste of resources as the more I study the lower my grades are. Occasionally I'm so low-spirited I lay myself on bed and don't give a damn to following exams as I forecast I would presumably get a bad grade. It annoys me as I'm a perfectionist when I apply my time at something. It doesn't matter how hard I try, the simpler the tasks the bigger my failures are. It relates to my life wide-wise. Driving is one of the things that upsets me as well as I constantly get scratches or light hits. Judging distances and depth is a nightmare even though I don't have any problem within my eyes. I usually get anxious when parking at tight spots and sometimes I'm even ""pushed away"" of the driving steer by female friends. Another drop down to my confidence. Before getting myself into driving I already felt I lacked of manhood and being a loser as well in something males are usually good is painful. I had problems with alcohol and gambling because of being depressed due to the reasons above. Gambling affected my life hugely. Formerly, I had the impression my life was ""mortgaged"" as result of the previously stated events. Now it's like I'm really ""mortgaged"" for good. Another drawbacks: lack of perception during social interactions (misunderstanding of irony per example), being ingenuous and a short-sleeve. I end most of the days angry at myself, now and then I throw and break stuff, mostly electronics or common day things. It's been 2 years since I started considering suicide. I was clinically check during that time (purposely concealed the small penis drama) and took some pills. In my opinion they were a waste of money. I'm still alive basically for the reason that my parents are supportive as I'm their only son. Likewise I have a couple of friends I don't want to let down with my death. None of them know I have a kid's penis as I do my best to hide it. Sometimes I wish I had uncaring parents and zero friends as I would be sort of ""allowed"" to commit suicide and end this torment. Before I end, I know it's a little bit ""selfish"" putting an end to my life because of the problems I told. There are guys out there striving to dodge air strikes or hunger. You can add people with unchangeable health states like down syndrome to mention one. But at least people acknowledge their life sucks. In the other hand, I'm judged as someone with a good life, when I feel dreadfully disturbed. I'm judged as someone ""healthy"", and I almost don't have a penis.

"Gained 10lbs over easter So in the past 13 months I have lost 230lbs, I have changed my entire eating habits and learned what is actually healthy vs what I thought was healthy.  Well this past weekend on Saturday my wife and I went out with friends of mine from work.  I got a burger with fries, while still under my calorie goal I gained a few pounds.  Then on Sunday it was Easter so I had ham, potato salad, mac salad, and one deviled egg.  I was over my calories by only a few hundred calories.    The next day I weighed myself and had gained 8lbs over the weekend.  Then yesterday I kept to my plan and worked out like usual and this morning I gained about 1.6lbs for a total of 9.6lbs gained.    This is more weight gained in a weekend than what I have lost in over 2 weeks.  It is driving me insane and actually makes me want to break down and cry, I feel like all that hard work over the last few weeks were for nothing.    I know I didn't eat an extra 30K calories and its mostly water/salt but fuck does this suck.    Is anyone else going though the same thing?   Anyone watching their weight and now fretting over weight gained during the holiday weekend?  "	cc

"Frustrated and hating myself. Hi all,  Writing this is super difficult for be because I've been through depression and spates of wanting to commit suicide myself but in the end this isn't about me. It's about my girlfriend.  Starting off I'll give a bit of context and backstory to the situation. We started dating a year ago and while she had depression then she was high functioning and her risk assessment was very low (I have training in risk assessment and prevention) however, after a while she had to move a good distance away for post-secondary. It was around this time she started to degrade. I made it a point to visit her as often as I could (about once a week for a weekend) as my job allowed it. I recently lost my job and moved down to be with her, initially I hoped that that would help her but it seemed to have to opposite effect. Recently I got a new job and have been working longer hours. Tonight I came home to her in the worst of her episodes to date. She shut me out of our room and broke down. I've been trying to get her to agree to go see a professional but she insists that doing so gives her depression power and that she wants to die. Her risk assessment was vastly worse that when I had previously done it and to be honest I'm running out of ideas. My biggest fear is coming home to find that she's hurt herself or worse. I need help. "	sw
"The choice of what I should and shouldn’t do I’ve suffered from anxiety and depression throughout my childhood, ptsd being the catalyst to my fall. Some time in middle school I was introduced to self harm and since then, in one way or another, I’ve harmed myself. Starving, cutting, bruising, scratching, punching, etc. It was an outlet, it was the only way I knew how to cope...  Therapy helped with some aspects of my illness from when I was five years old to now sixteen, but that didn’t mean the pain has stopped. I’ve learned ways to conceal the pain, how to make it go away in a healthy manner but the problem never went away.  I’m going through a new hurdle in my life, something I’ve never experienced and now I don’t know how to handle the situation. A silly teenage relationship that bloomed into the biggest problem I’ve faced in my life. The panic attacks don’t stop, the crying continues, the bad thoughts hoard my mind-  “Let’s go to that bridge up the street. The police still haven’t found that girl those two men threw over, maybe they won’t find you either”  Stop  “Remember in the 6th grade when you wrote a suicide note to your family and parents? Remember that park on the beach side of the lake? Hang yourself on the play equipment like you said you would”  No-  No?   I don’t know what to do and I don’t know how to handle my emotions. The crying isn’t stopping and the occasional thought of killing myself is a constant flicker in the back of my mind and I can’t focus on anything...   Whatever happens, I’m sorry."	sw

"Waiting for temporary restraining order, scared in my own home. So last Sunday, the 25th of March, I [21 F] was at my local police station in NJ for three hours to get a temporary restraining order from my ex [24 M] who lives in Staten Island, NY. I was told he would be served within a couple of days and it’s been over a week now. He is still messaging me via social media on a fake account he created because I blocked all the other ones and he still sends random texts now and then in addition to the online messages. He made over 10 fake numbers off of texting apps to text and call me non stop and it’s still going on to this day. Yes, he has threatened my life and I have evidence of it BUT still no word if he has gotten served or not. I don’t know how much longer I can handle feeling scared in my own home and just dealing with this in general. It’s really driving me insane.   I went to court this past Thursday for the first time about this matter and met a lady from the Safe and Sound organization. She told me basically what I needed to do to get this rolling and that I need to get my order amended because there’s just not enough information on the order itself. After my name was called in the court room my case was put off to the next week, Thursday, April 5th, and the lady from Safe and Sound gave me some info about the organization and took me where I had to go to get my order amended. However, I couldn’t stay longer than I did that morning because it was such a last minute thing and I had other things I was supposed to do. So, I am going back to the courthouse today (Tuesday, April 3rd) and try to amend my order.   I called my local NJ police station to see what’s going on with him being served and I was told to call the 800 number on the report. So I did that and the man who answered said that, that service was not available in NJ. I also called the Staten Island Police station and they told me that my local station should have that info BUT my local station didn’t help me the first time I called. The officer who I talked to from my local station said to maybe call them back in the morning about it but I just feel so.... helpless and just a “why am I even bothering” feeling.  It’s 3:30 AM and I’m so upset I can’t even sleep. I just want peace. I recently just went through a move, I help my mom take care of my I’ll grandfather (which is really challenging because the man raised me and I hate seeing him in this condition AND it’s just a lot of work/stress being a caretaker. You get almost no downtime or just time for yourself.) My mom and I finally figured out a schedule so I can finally get a job again while needing to care for my grandfather so I’ve been going to interviews. I have no time and or patience anymore to keep dealing with this...   I just feel like I’m gonna give up soon. This harassment from my ex has been going on for months. I thought it was just going to die down but it never did so I finally did something about it. It’s just like it’s not a big deal to the officers I talk to meanwhile I’m afraid to be in my own house and I’ve been living like this for months now.   I just need some advice, some experience... something. I’m really coming to the end of my rope, I can only stretch so thin.  "	sw

I would do anything to smile.. All I want to do is smile. Smile back at people that smile at me at work. Smile at pets walking by trying to get my attention. Smile at myself in the mirror. But I can't. I won't. I'm too ashamed of my crooked teeth. It is my own fault. I hate myself every waking day. I just want to be normal and smile like everybody else. People want to talk to me but I act like I don't care. Truth is I do. I'm just too ashamed. I was also overweight at one point. But I figured of I lost weight I would feel more confident. It didn't help at all. Made it worse. Yes I feel healthier. More confident  in a way but now more people want to talk to me and I hate it. I think I will kill my self someday. Maybe not now. But someday. The liquor helps. Thanks for ready	sw
"I'm a worthless idiot and deserve to die Ever since I was 12 I was bullied, I was called ugly and told to kill myself. My bullies would beat me up, while their friends would laugh. The girls at my school told me that I'm so ugly that they would rather die than be my friends. I was told that I would die alone almost everyday. During my final year at high school my best friend moved away and I was alone in the last year of high school.   Now it has been threeyears since I finished high school but I still don't get over it. Everyday I think about them and think about how weak I am. They were right. I am 19 now, I have never had a girlfriend, I never tried talking to a girl after high school because I fear and know what they would say ""you are ugly, fuck off"", I never went to parties because I am afraid of getting beaten or bullied there. I feel like I'm just to ugly and worthless to live.   goodbye reddit and goodbye world"	sw
"I missed a perfect opportunity Today I was walking home, after my 1 hour train ride, and a car pulled up into a church driveway rather quickly, about 50 meters (150ft) ahead of me.   Two really gorgeous girls got out of the car and started searching the windscreen and the top of the car (at first thought, I thought they’d broken their windscreen).   I reached the car and stopped and asked if there was something wrong, to which they replied “there’s a spider somewhere”.   Me, an arachnophobe, instantly turned back on my path, laughed and said “you’re on your own”. They laughed too, but a solid 2 seconds later I’d realised I’d quite literally turned my back on two girls *basically* asking for help. Instant regret and remorse.  I don’t know why I wanted to share this here but I just feel like I fucked up a good opportunity to help them out with their spider issue and chat to them, ask for one of their numbers or something, I don’t know.  Should I have helped? Or am I just fantasising and just made a natural decision?"	cc

"Do you think that love is the answer? Do you think that the fulfillment, the longing for tender caress will save someone who never experienced reciprocal love before? Help me guys. I am heartbroken, in pain. She was playing with me all this time, a thought i had a chance. How foolish of me to think that. I do not understand. How can someone, who has been haunted by suicidal ideations almost all his life, feel so much love and affection, and never had the luck to have those feeling returned to me? You know what kept me alive all this time? HOPE! I thought someone would love me someday, i thought someone would show me that i matter, that she values me as i value others. All hope is gone. She was my last hope. I am at rage with myself for believing. I am really tired.  I am done, close to crying, how pathetic. Almost three fucking decades old and never been truly happy. What is the point of living? Tell me please, what is the point when you are not important. Why do i feel so much, i don't want to feel love anymore, nor pain, nor anything.    Why am i writing here again.... i guess i have nobody else to talk to. I am lonely, emotionally neglected. I wish i had someone to hug me. I am made of scars, scars that i fear will never fully heal. I will escape this reality, and i am at peace with the thoughts of the eternal sleep. Never to feel pain, never to see her, or anyone else.

"I just need people to talk to... Hi, I'm very heart broken. It may not seem serious, and I'm honestly confused myself.   My boyfriend broke up with me 2 days ago. He said our Long Distance Relationship wasn't going to work out. We've been together for 8 short months, but it was honestly the best 8 months of my life. He made me ridiculously happy.   I have never been depressed in my life, I've had my own problems, mostly financial, been homeless for years. But never truly depressed.   But this, this break up took a toll on me. I haven't eaten yet, nor have I stopped crying. I tried so hard to forget and move on. But I just couldn't.   I was saving up to go visit him in a few months, but I was keeping it from him as a secret; which I now regret. I told him, but he told me to stop day dreaming, as it was never going to happen.   I'm still going to save up and meet him, im hoping that that'll help our relationship. We truly loved each other, but due to certain circumstances, my and his schedule did not match for about a week and a half, we were not able to be with each other that often. But our schedules are fixed now, but his feelings for me aren't there anymore.   I am truly, for once in my life, devastatingly depressed. I feel sad, but feel nothing at all at the same time. I'm distracting myself with people to talk to, but not everyone can talk to me all the time.   Living is harder, knowing that he's out there not having a hard time, enjoying his time alone. I'm afraid of myself."	sw

I’m so scared I don’t want to hurt anyone, but if I tell someone they’ll think I’m crazy. I can’t escape, I’m stuck. The only way is for me to kill myself, I would be lying if I said I wasn’t scared of death. Hell im terrified of death, but it’s the only way to get out of this. I never thought things will get this bad, I never thought that I would actually do it. I’m still considering it, but I’m pretty sure I’m gonna have to. I just want to be free from this, I can’t trust anyone. I feel like they’re judging me, thinking that I’m sick. I’m not, I just want a little help that’s all. I can’t say that, it’s a cruel world. I guess it depends what’s I’m gonna do now, I just want my suffering to end. Why can’t I feel normal for once, I wish people understood.

"Tylenol It's been five months with this spell of depression. Most days I can barely get out of bed or take a shower. Today though I got out of bed. I took a bath and shaved my legs. I put make up on. I went to target. It was strange. I've been cooped up in my house for 3 months straight so target in my reality felt like I landed on mars. Nothing felt real. While i was there I bought a pretty black dress with white flowers on it. I also bought a bottle of tylenol. I got home and binged and purged. Drank a 40 and fell asleep. Woke up and I'm nursing another 40. I am now going through old journals and sketchbooks. Wow. It's a surreal feeling reading back on your old life and realizing nothing has changed. I was depressed and suicidal in 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014. It's the same shit, different day. But today was a success in my book.

I have been thinking about this in my life ever since. for example, I'll post something on a mom group and three to five people will respond. another person will post and get 20+ replies.   does anyone else notice this? why does this happen?   what makes a good conversationalist?"	cc

What program are you in?  * Me: Guess.  * *one guessing game followed by me tryna guess Jebus' program*  * Me: So what do you like about it?  * Jebus: *Tells me what he likes about it*  * And then I'll create an engaging discussion about whatever the fuck's on my mind cause I'm a Good Conversationalist™  One of the reasons I like talking to people who are older than me is cause they tend to skip the scripts and go right to more naturally flowing small talk. If a person my age skips the scripts, I take that as a sign that they have serious social skills and I have a special place in my attention reserves for them.  Also, fun fact about me: In the current draft of a novel I'm writing, the main character (also a uni student) runs into a lot of people who try to use the first script with him and it pisses him off because of how predictable it is. He makes his best friend during the following conversation:  ""What program are you in?""  ""Fuck off with the bullshit small talk, no one actually cares what program anyone else is in""  ""Honestly, I was hoping someone would say that to me all week""  What kinds of spins do you put on predictable small talk in your own life?"	cc

"maybe someone to talk to Hi,  I’ve written a note and I’ve started laying out the pills, I’m smoking cigarettes to keep busy and try and delay the inevitable. I’m 20, female, work full time in a good job. I lost a parent figure when I was young, and was gang raped in an alleyway when I was 13. I had to have an abortion. No one knew until I came out about it when I was 16. Then it made sense to my family the reason the way I was acting. I’ve built this personality of strength and being a Phoenix from the ashes of how far I’ve come. But when alone I cry and I don’t feel any emotion behind it. I don’t feel sad towards my past, I just cry. I don’t know what to do. I’ve tried before and failed, and feel embarrassed about my mental health. I don’t feel good enough. I love going to work and working hard as it takes my mind off of everything and I feel as though I have a purpose. I work myself so hard that I come home with a headache and fall asleep straight away. I go all day without eating/drinking as I forget. I feel like I’m in a loop. "	sw

"I want to kill myself Ok, so I'm 22F and honestly, I just want to kill myself. I am on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medication, and I go to a therapist once a week, but nothing seems to be helping. Before I never really thought that I would act on these thoughts, but I am getting closer to really wanting to with every passing day. I've contemplated suicide in the past, but I have never felt so strongly about it as I do now.   I am currently in university, and I am not doing very well in my classes. Three out of the four classes that I was taking were extremely hard for me this term and I am trying to just get through my exams now. I just want to be done... I only have 3 more semesters left, but I honestly don't know if I can do it.   I have multiple diseases that cause me chronic pain and struggles. These will never be cured, and I am so sick and tired of living with them. People don't and can't understand what it's like.   I also have ADHD and OCD that is currently under control with medications.   I have no friends, but I do have a great boyfriend. He's honestly the only person that keeps me going. He is aware I feel this way, I just don't know if he understands how serious it is.   My mom and I get along usually, but she is so hard to read and sometimes will absolutely snap at you for the littlest things. She doesn't know I am feeling this way again, because the last time I told her she freaked out at me.   All I want to do is either lay in bed for the rest of my life (or until I am ready to face the world again), or kill myself. I want to end it all now because I honestly don't think things will ever get better.   The only thing keeping me going honestly is the kids I babysit and my boyfriend. Without them I think I would have been gone from this world a long time ago. "	sw

"A moment of happiness cannot replace a lifetime of suffering. It gets better.  God I hate that phrase. Can it get better? Maybe. But, despite it getting better, it can and likely will get worse as well.  I'm in the best place I've been in my entire life, and everyday I wish I had killed myself in my youth or died in an accident or something. The panic attacks are increasing. The suicidal ideation is flourishing and I already have a plan. I'm living everyday, waiting for the trigger that will push me over the edge and finally let me end things.  I talked to my father after work today (he also has depression). I tell him what upsets me, but all he can tell me is ""You have nothing to be sad about! Your doing great!"" Yeah ok dad, thanks I guess if my depression doesn't meet his standards then it must mean I'm just a big complainer. How dare I not be happy?   I just want it all to end. I want it to be over.  I hope you all had a better day than I did. :/"	sw

"Everything Feels Empty I want to get my story out there, so maybe this community is a good place to start…  I'm a 20 years old trans girl from Brazil. I've been suffering through depression and anxiety since I was a little kid, I've been told I was a mistake and worthless by my parents countless times even as a child… I had problems in school but instead of solving any of them my parents just beat me and threw me in a public school where I was beaten and bullied every day. Maybe the only friend I had back then was my brother, but we were distant in a sense since he has Asperger's… but we got along and watched cartoons together while our parents shouted to each others and shut doors down around the house.  When I turned 12 I was finally back in a particular school, a good one, but I didn't really perform well in it as my depression was already piling up on me even then… and all the matters and teaching system were way more superior than what I was used to… so I was basically performing extremely subpar… which obviously destroyed my self-esteem and I'd feel like a worthless disappointment.  Around 12, also, is when my gender dysphoria started to peak as a child… I'd cry every night wanting to be a girl even if I didn't know why it happened… it just did… and it stung even more that at school the girls wouldn't really even try to socialize with me… everyone deemed me gross and hideous.  15 years old came by and I was still in the same school, just high school, and my (late) puberty hit me… which obviously just made everything go even more downhill as I started to get more and more masculine… it was also very fat since 6… so I just got fatter. I was also doing extremely subpar in highschool… which, once again, still made me feel empty and worthless.  At 18 I miraculously entered the top university of my country for Linguistics (I'm not sure how, but I was called in the 4th wait list). It took me a semester of happiness, but things started to go back to as they were before… I got unmotivated quickly and noticed I chose my course wrongly as I was hating it… around that time I was also living by myself with my brother in São Paulo and even started my hormonal therapy at 19 in 2017.   Even if things were shitty in uni, I was still losing weight and becoming more feminine and I started to blossom socially. I'd attract people that were romantically interested, even went in dates and made friends in bars… but then… I was date raped one day.  I couldn't do much about it, the guy didn't leave any marks or bruises and there was no way to prove it happened, and I was also terrified to go go the police because I was still presenting male… and I know they'd not take a ""man"" seriously in a rape claim… and with how homophobic and transphobic Brazil is… I even feared worse…  So with that… I started to just stay home crying things off and spent months just in bed… I started to grow nearly obese again and my friends started to abandon me as ""I am too much of a bummer""… I also gad dropped uni…  After a few months… my really anti-LGBT parents caught up that I was on hormones and I was met with the ultimatum: stop it or you're out. The only thing keeping me together was over… in 3 months, most of the progress I had of 7 months of hormones were over as Testosterone is a really potent thing… so my gender dysphoria went even more severe…  Nowadays I'm just bed struck and have some social gatherings I go to… I can barely look at myself in the mirror and acknowledging my genitals literally throws me in panic attacks…  I'm now back on my hormones because I really don't care anymore… I'm just making things more bearable until I finally off myself… that is, if Brazil doesn't kill me first as my life expectancy as a trans woman here is 30… since this country is literally the most violent towards us in the world (even more than Iran… in Iran it's actually socially acceptable).  I still have some shallow friendships but they all feel empty as I have to be a man around people… and I just can't take it anymore…"	sw
"Matter of time I have to talk myself out of suicide every night. I cry myself to sleep all the time. I've been clinically depressed for years and it's only getting worse. I'm posting here as basically a last resort. I know I'm going to do it one day soon but this small part of me wants things to get better even though I know they won't. I've done countless hours of research on suicide and I know how I'm going to do it as well. If anyone is going to waste their time and comment with things like ""stay strong"" and ""things will get better"" please don't waste your time. Honestly, I don't even know why I'm posting here.

"Becoming the writer of your story rather than a character It's times like these where I feel a bit overwhelmed by everything kinda hitting me all at once, whether it's school, work, or life in general, I almost physically feel pulled down by the weight on my shoulders  And although there are things I could do to lighten this weight, I decided to do the opposite and take on more responsibilities, things that push me out of my comfort zone and arguably stress me out, but should also help me grow  It was after one certain event, although minor and pretty irrelevant, that pushed me to basically throw caution to the wind and say screw it, I'm tired of being comfortable all the time and losing out on experiences that I know will be beneficial, for example volunteering at a local elementary school or attending a networking event alone as a first year student  Granted I've done these things before, but the feeling of being uncomfortable wasn't something I enjoyed, I mean yeah duh obviously right who wants to be uncomfortable haha but it's made me realize that I'm really the biggest detractor when it comes to promoting my own growth  So instead of being that person who is scared, nervous, or unsure, I want to be the person that really shows myself the way, almost like looking into the mirror and telling myself that that person isn't me, but it's my job to make this person the best human being they can possibly be, it's not me who's uncomfortable anymore but rather it's  the person I'm guiding, I just have to give them encouragement  And I could keep trucking along but one thing to realize is that the decisions you make and/or don't make have a direct effect on the development of this character in your story  And if you really want to have an amazing character, you cannot stay the same and *comfortable* through it all  What are your thoughts? Another way I thought about it was like an rpg haha this life of ours is a character that we want to become great and powerful, but to get to that point we have to go through the trials and tribulations, you can try but solely killing level 1 monsters or completing beginner quests will only take you so far"	cc

"I drove a random stranger back to their home. Settle down folks, this is gonna be a long one!  It was a Thursday morning about three or four weeks ago and I was sat in my Pharmacology class slowly feeling the impeding doom of an anxiety attack. I was toying with the idea of ditching the class I had after lunch and going home to play some video games in hopes of making my day better. Lunch time rolls around and I decide to go home, I pick up my favourite salad and drive home.   I'm about to dig in when I think to myself M1chael_Burnham, this could tastes 100 times better if you inhaled some dead plant smoke. So I quickly roll up and head outside to smoke. As I'm walking around the corner (my apartment block is on the corner of a busy main road and a dead end, I prefer to smoke on the dead end road) I see a girl across the road looking lost and I start repeating ""please don't ask for directions"" quietly to myself. I stupidly make eye contact with her and she shouts across the road asking where she was. Being the nice person I am I decide to explain to her, ""you're on Discovery"". I chuckled myself as I found myself in a situation I didn't want to be in, but that was fine. She crosses the street and she explains that she isn't a local, she looked desperate, lost and scared. I ask her where she's from and she tells me she's from a town that's 30mins away and then she just started bawling her eyes out explaining that she had been spiked the night before and had spent the most part of the day locked in a strange man's room. She'd just had to push the guy out of the way with the door as he came back into the room and just ran until she found me. She asked if she could use my phone to call a friend, he didn't pick up. I asked her if she wanted to get the police involved because I know some people are a bit iffy about policemen/women. She immediately says no, I then suggest giving her directions to the nearest bus station and she says she has no money, she only had a very old Nokia phone on her and she was wearing a hoodie, leggings and some Nikes. As I looked closely at her I noticed visible bruises on her wrists & back of neck, I really wanted to call the police but I also didn't want to make her feel like she cannot trust me. We tried calling her friend again and there was no answer. As I'm looking around me I see my car parked on the road and I just blurt out that I'll take her home since it's only a 30min drive. I immediately regret it as I realise I'm inviting a complete stranger into my car, I further explain that I'll only take her if a friend of mine comes with us, just to be safe and she was fine with that. If anything she was grateful.   We jump in the car, pick up my friend (who happened to be about a mile away luckily). I offered the girl some breakfast bars I keep in my car for homeless people and she just devoured them, like she hadn't eaten in days. Again I think about calling the police so I  ask her her age just to make sure I'm not driving a minor and she says sh2es 22, I didn't believe her but she had an expired provisional license on her which confirmed her age. I made sure to drive as safe as possible because I didn't want to have a car crash or something with a total stranger in the car, how would I explain that one!?  We get to her house and her friend we'd tried calling earlier was standing outside visibly freaked out (I think they'd been out together the night before) he was very grateful for bringing her back. I gave the girl my number just to keep in contact and she said she'd call or text to let me know how she's doing. She didnt.   I feel stupid, like I got played/lied to. On the other hand I couldn't just leave her to fend for herself because if I had been in her situation I'd want help too.  I don't know if I'm over thinking it but I feel like I shouldn't have taken her home, that I should have called the police and had them help her. No one but my boyfriend and the friend who came with me know, and I guess you guys now. Was I wrong? Should I have left her? Should I have called the police?  Tl:dr - drove a stranger home, probably should have called the police to help as she was far from home and a potential victim of abuse  Edit: forgot Tl;dr"	cc

"I just want the pain to stop So, if you look in my history you'll see that my ex and I divorced in January and we had a child together. She meant everything to me until my son was born. I was abused as a child so I don't speak to any of my own family, her family basically adopted me into their family. I believe they still care about me, they invited me over for Easter so that I wouldn't be alone.  I probably shouldn't have gone, it made things worse, but I had my son for Easter and didn't want to keep him from them either.  I still love my ex, deeply and I want her to be happy. The problem is, she was giggling while typing on her phone half the time. I knew what was going on. I tried not to let it show but I'm pretty sure it did, it killed me. I'm so conflicted, on one hand I want her to be happy even above my own happiness so I'm happy she's happy, but on the other it kills me that she's moved on so fast.  I've tried to go on dates. One girl made fun of my teeth and left, another I went on a couple of dates with and she was nice and it even progressed to her initiating an intimate relationship. I couldn't perform, I felt this massive amount of depression and guilt. It felt like I was cheating on my ex. I'd rather be alone than feel that again.  The only thing that's keeping me alive is knowing that my son needs his father, but I'm beginning to wonder if that's the case. If I weren't in the picture, my ex could freely find someone else and it wouldn't hurt me since I wouldn't be here. My son is 2 and wouldn't remember me if I were to die now. My ex could find a nice man that could replace me as a father figure, which is what I want, I want my son to have a great father figure in his life that can teach him to be a good person with a huge heart.  Edit: I was thinking about trying to find a way to make it look like an accident so my son doesn't grow up thinking I didn't want to be with him. I love him and don't want him to feel that way, I just feel like everyone, including him, is better off without me alive."	sw

"i don't know how much longer i can hold on i almost killed myself tonight. i guess i'll provide a little background about myself...not that it'll matter soon.   hi, my name is savannah. i am 18 years old and i have been struggling on and off with bipolar since i was 12. i was diagnosed with ocd at age 13, social aniexty and hypochondria at 14. i have tried to kill myself in the past multiple times. the first time is when i was 12. the second time, i was 14. i tried twice when i was 15. i almost succeeded when i was 16. i failed at succeeding when i 17. and that brings us back to present day. my ocd has been really bad lately as well as my bipolar. my parents both think i'm faking feeling this way, that it's all part if 'being a teen'. my mom said i'm a mistake. my dad and mom have both called me multiple (rude) names. none of my siblings care about me. i'm not lying when i say i literally have 0 friends. it seems that nobody really does care about me. everytime i try to ask someone for help, they just laugh and tell me to deal with it. that there are more serious problems in this world. going back to earlier this evening, i went for a walk. i left around 700 pm. around 8:30 pm, i came up to the train tracks. i heard a train in the distance (and i saw it's lights) and i kept thinking to myself 'should i die right now? will i actually succeed this time?' (keep in mind the train was still pretty far back so i kept asking myself if i should go through with it.) as the train got closer, i stood in the middle of the tracks and faced the train. i closed my eyes and whispered to myself 'this is it. i'm finally going to die'. the train horn was blaring constantly and i don't know if it was because he saw me standing there, or if he was just blowing the horn as the train neared the crossing. as it got even closer, the horn was blaring more constantly. at this point, i figured he saw me. the train was i would estimate about 10 seconds away from hitting me when i stepped off the tracks. i don't know why i did but something came over me at last second. the speed of the train actually knocked me down as it passed. my left hand ended up getting cut by a rusty nail that was in the road. it took about 4 minutes for the train to fully pass and i was just sitting on the ground crying the whole time. i kept hitting myself. after about 2 minutes, i got up and started walking home. i kept repeating the same question over and over again in my head. 'why didn't i go through with it? what is wrong with me?' my dog greeted me when i walked in the door but i just nudged him away and went upstairs. (i never ignore my dog like that). now, i'm laying in bed, writing about how terrible my life is even though i know nobody will care.   i'm gonna be completely honest, i know i'm going to kill myself someday. the question isn't how I'm going to do it, the question is when. tell me, is there a reason to keep going even if everybody around you wants you dead?   disclaimer: i have seem multiple therapists and such and none of them have helped. so i really don't know what to do anymore.  any tips would help i guess. if i don't reply, i think you know what that means.

"I'm finally able to cope better with the stress of everything! Bit of back story:  I have suffered from depression and anxiety from a young age and have attempted suicide multiple times (Thank you to the doctors whom saved me). About 6 months ago, my SO of nearly 3 years cheated on me, and broke up with me in the worst way possible (on a trip to Paris that we've planned from the start of the whole relationship). I have had a pretty major operation and landed in ICU for a day because my body started giving up after the operation. For 3 months afterwards, I was bed bound (Was on multiple types of pain relief such as morphine etc) I also developed pneumonia shortly after moving back to my own house forcing me back to my family home. I have missed out months of university, and gave up with everything. I started getting screened for cancer because of some problems with the postOP tests. A month ago, both my grandparents ended up in hospital (grandad had 3 major heart surgeries within the space of 2 days and grandmother has had reoccurring heart attacks) and my grandad is being screened for lung cancer (he doesn't smoke).   Now for the less sad part: I'm really down because of everything, but I am able to finally help out my family and support them without constantly breaking down and thinking of the fastest way out. For the past month I've realised that there is so much to live for, I haven't ever felt like this in the short life that I've lived so far. I'm happy I can gather myself together for my family and everyone around me around such a negative time. This might just be a short burst of self-esteem, but I've never had such a thing happen to me before and I can see happiness through everything that has happened.

If I'm just relaxing, watching some funny YouTube videos, laughing, I keep on wondering whether I'll soon experience the visual aura and the migraine will pop back.   It makes it really hard to enjoy life. I also have a really hard time with eating after an attack since everything makes me worried and nauseous.   I truly hate migraines - not just while they last!

"anniversary   Yesterday was the four-year anniversary of my beginning to self-harm. April 3rd has always been the day of relapse for me.    Last November I was hospitalized after an overdose. The EMT taking me to the hospital told me that I need to think about what my death would have done to my family. As if that wasn't the one thing preventing me from a serious attempt this whole time. The doctors and nurses kept asking me why I did it, and I had no reason to give them. How is it that being done with this fucked up world isn't enough? I ended up lying through my teeth to get released.    I have been diagnosed with MD and anxiety. I have a support network of family and friends, and three different counselors. It seems like none of this helps me in a time of crisis. I'm awful at asking people for help.   I just want to die. How is this such a big thing to ask for? Death is inevitable, anyways. It's the final goal. How is it that the one thing I'm willing to fight for is the only thing my body is fighting against?"	sw

Recently I opened myself to a very good friend of mine and I have to say that the support I received was amazing, it really helped me but only for a while.. I honestly tried a lot of things to get out of this dark place but I keep falling here everytime and I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know if I should've included my friend in this because it only made her feel worse. God I'm such a bad friend. Probably next time I will attempt to do end it, I will go until it is finished.

"Circle of Trust was an interesting experiment. But not a ""fun"" one. I think Reddit really spoiled us with the /r/thebutton, and /r/place .  /r/Circleoftrust was intesting *and* boring for users.  **Interesting** because eventually ever circle, no matter how much effort was put on it, would be betrayed around ~100 member. By the end of the event, a few circles with +200 members existed (also betrayed). So basically, don't trust over a hundred people at the same time in the Internet.  **Boring** because there wasn't any chat, any notification of new members **with their names**, and a limit to betrayals. It would be interesting if people held their betrayals. It would definitely get some charity circles a lot of members before being betrayed.  ---  I really didn't want a new /r/place , but I hoped for something that would be more engaging. We did /r/brasil circleoftrust, where I would invite people that post in our subreddit, but it was *really boring* to manually invite people.  What do you think?

"I just flooded part of my coworkers’ house. I’m housesitting for a very “by-the-rules” coworker who I also consider a personal friend. Her cats are spoiled and one of them gets to drink from the sink when he asks for it. This morning I turned the sink on a low trickle and then got distracted, leaving the house soon after. I worked an 8 hour job, came back to the house, and then left to go see a movie with some friends. When I got back here about an hour ago I noticed that water was dripping through the ceiling and into the kitchen. When I ran upstairs their bathroom was flooded, multiple drawers filled with water, counter and floor completely covered in water. I called my girlfriend who walked me through cleaning it up. Most of the water is out of the bathroom, but it is still dripping through the floor into their kitchen. The worst part is that they just built their house last year. I feel terrible, but I know all I can do is offer to cover any expenses that result from this. It’s also a bummer because it took me years to build this friendship with this coworker and now I’m just waiting for them to get home tomorrow at noon so I can break it to them.

"I decided I wanted to play a “silly” sport in college + as a reason for weight loss I’m a junior in high school right now and I’m, well, extremely overweight and have been since childhood. I’ve gained and lost it back multiple times and I decided by the time I go to college, I’m going to lose 90 pounds, learn how to keep it off, and join my dream school’s Dodgeball Team. I’ve never done team sports (bc I’m kinda socially awkward and overweight) and it’s a good motivator for me to lose weight! I told my mom and she said dodgeball isn’t a real sport but I’ve been talking to current members through Facebook and they have like a whole collegiate ranking system and a rule book and they travel to other states and it’s a whole thing. So, needless to say, fuck off mom. But yeah.

"So, I pulled a ""stunt"" at work this week... First off, sorry about the throwaway account. I really want to spill my guts to all of you great strangers of the internet, but don't want to leave so much identifiable info about me and my job on my main account. Also, sorry for the novel.  Anyway, I work as a drafter at an engineering firm, and am the low man on the totem pole for the electrical department. I've learned a lot over my time at the company & the engineers I work under have slowly been giving me more and more design responsibility, particularly for easier things like laying out lighting and plugs and stuff.  So we recently got this project. Its a complete gut and remodel of a pretty large existing building & they asked me to do the existing conditions field survey since everyone else in the department was busy with other projects & the building in question was going to be a simple place to survey  (an empty building with few interior walls). I've done many field surveys before (usually they give me the easier ones like this), so it wasn't anything new for me.  The project itself is a pretty intense & will require completely new electrical everything, including a whole new electrical service. Thankfully, while its a very large project with lots of electrical work, we've been doing quite a few projects lately that are very similar to this one (albeit much smaller). Because of the similar projects, I have direct experience with (or at least a reference to) a majority of the design components in this project, with 1 huge exception... The electrical distribution.  While the engineers trust me to do many of the simpler tasks for them, I've never really had the opportunity to touch the electrical distribution before. The engineers have been really awesome, though, and often explain their designs (and their thought processes regarding them) to me when they give me their markups. Because of these explanations, I feel like I at least know the basics of how everything works.  Earlier this week, we received the official go-ahead to start on this project, but due to disorganization in our department & everyone in the department being totally slammed with other projects, that go-ahead fell on deaf ears. I decided to kind-of use this as an opportunity to try to get out of my comfort zone a bit.  I send an email to the engineers in the department asking if I could take a stab at taking this project as my own & designing the whole thing. Of course, before I sent this email, I went ahead and did all of the preliminary design work (including the electrical distribution) on my own & without permission (figuring that its always better to beg forgiveness than ask permission).  The head honcho engineer came over shortly after I sent the email to discuss the email I sent. He was a bit skeptical, but overall fine with the idea, particularly after I mentioned that a majority of the project is quite similar to a few others & that I was the one who did the field survey. After he gave his blessing, I showed him what I had already come up with for the design. He sat down with me for a few hours and we went through what I had already come up with (particularly the electrical distribution).  During the discussion, I mentioned that I took some pretty big guesses on sizing based on what looked right from other projects. He went through the design with me & showed me the actual math associated with designing something like this. Surprisingly, my guesses turned out to be correct & he actually mentioned that the design looked like something that he would have come up with.  I know it sounds kind-of dumb, but I really feel like I accomplished something & I've never felt so excited about work before. Hell, the owner of the company actually came over to my desk today & said that he was proud of me (I have no idea how word of my stunt got around so quickly).  I mean, I know that its still super early in the game & I have plenty of opportunities to totally crash & burn on this project, but right now, I feel on top of the world. :)"	cc

"I'm a living failure. I was forced to go on a trip because my mom didn't want to deal with my grandma's complaints due to me staying at home. But no one ever considered my opinion. I tried to go there and get the best out of it. I had raised my hopes a bit. But the higher you stand, the higher you fall... I remember getting there early in the morning. Like, getting out of here at approx. 8AM. I got there at about 10. And I don't know, during the trip me and my family had an argument. When I got there I watched some TV and went for a swim. But I spent like 1 hour just sitting on the pool stairs, thinking. And my mom went to talk with me. She was trying to tell me that I need to loosen up. But I don't know, I just kept trying to find reasons to not do so. I didn't even wanna go on the first place. Then, after I was done, I went to take a bath and spent the rest of the day doing nothing. Then, as night fell, I went to search for some bugs and found a few spiders and Argo, a grasshopper. He was drowning in the pool so I picked him up and set him free. But he didn't wanna leave me. So he just stood there. Perched on my finger for some time. And I just stood there, with him, reflecting on everything. When I was just laying in bed, playing, some guy tossed a used diaper at me. I got so mad, I've got some anger issues tbh... Then I layed down and had some real hard time sleeping. I went to sleep at like 2AM and woke up by 7. Then I spent the whole morning watching TV with my Mom's boyfriend's daughter, and just chatted about our daily life. Then as I was going downstairs some asshole there sprayed water on me with a hose and I got mad at him. Then. My mom got mad at me for not doing anything when I went downstairs. We had a barbecue, and when I went to get something to eat, the same guy gave me some skewed cheese, even though he knew the skewer was burning, he told me to pick it up. And I felt nervous, and my mom was yelling at me about it. When I picked it up, my finger burnt so bad, I practically hurled the skewer across the room. It left a pretty nasty burn on my finger. When I was going upstairs to be alone for a bit, I picked up an umbrella because it was reeeeal rainy and at that same moment the wind knocked a Bluetooth speaker down from a wood beam close to where I was. And, jokingly, one of my relatives said it was me and people believed it. Skip forward a few hours, as I went to take a bath, I overheard my name and started paying attention to people downstairs. My mom saw me looking at them and thought I was staring at her. Then she started staring back and got mad at me again. As I was heading to the bathroom, I overheard my mom saying ""don't mind him, he's retarded."" And I don't know why, but that really struck me. Then I spent like a literal hour under the shower, just looking at my steamy reflection on a giant mirror they had inside the shower box. After I was done, a really annoying kid arrived and started to piss me off. I was holding me back not to throw him inside the pool. He's here right now by the way, and every 5 minutes he comes to knock on my door. What bothers me isn't even the fact that he's knocking, it's the fact that he just wants to play with my stuff. He doesn't want me. I'm just a walking laughing stock for everyone, it seems. That's how I feel at least. Everything I do is funny to someone in some degree. I feel like an animal in a zoo. Like a dog, just entertainment on legs. At night, when I wanted to just lay down on the couch, I asked my mom's boyfriend ""excuse me"" so he could let me through. But I accidentally bumped into him and he thought I was just pushing him aside. We got into a really heated argument. You could touch the tension in the air. then I went to sleep and today morning was just... Awkward. Packing was awkward. Having breakfast was awkward. Everything was awkward. The trip home, that kid kept bugging me to play with my PSP, even though he was playing on his own phone. Now I got home, and I just stood sat on my bed, holding back not to kill myself.  I'm sorry if I sounded bratty or played the victim card, I just... Sigh I don't know anymore...  "	sw

I ended up taking an Uber home because I didn’t want to wait 2 hours by myself in -20 weather. And honestly I think the same situation might happen tonight and I’d rather just avoid it entirely.   If the weather was nicer (currently -17 with wind chill) or I had someone to go with or could afford two uber rides I’d go.

"The cycle feels never ending I’m not sure where else to go so I’m going to give this a try. I’ve dealt with depression for as long as I can remember, it’s put me in the hospital/psych unit once already before about 2 years ago and since then I’ve held just about everything in and been able to compose myself on the outside. Inside my head has become an absolute hell. The last 3 weeks I’ve been in the worst depression of my life, which climaxed 2 days ago with me trying to drink myself to death and start cutting. I have never cut before but my friends found me alone after a night of drinking with all of them, and I went into a complete manic state. Telling them to take me to the hospital and saying how if they didn’t now I was going to end it all eventually, there was no stopping it. The next day when i woke I begged them not to take me anywhere or tell my parents, partly because i wanted to sober up and because I simply could not put them through that again. I’ve got cuts on my wrist and have a doctors appointment tomorrow because I’m trying to switch up meds. I’m considering cancelling because I’m scared of what she will say if she sees these cuts. I feel like I can get through it for a while if I stay sober, but obviously can’t make any promises at this point because I don’t have any real motivation for living. I’ve never made an attempt sober but I’m still scared of myself at times. I just really need advice on what to do, there is counseling available at the college I attend but I’m super anxious about going to anybody right now and then finding out about the cutting. Other than that my friends are pretty mortified by what they saw, and are going to be checking to make sure I make some type of move tomorrow in the right direction. Thanks for letting me talk, I’ve never posted before but just really needed to get it out. Any advice is helpful. Thanks. "	sw

Tonight she told me that she wants to run away from her parents to get away from everything. She claims they don’t care about her disorders and they don’t do anything to help her. While I don’t 100% believe this, she is not in a stable position right now and needs help. This has been going on for around 2 months now and i don’t know what is left that I can do at this point.   She may kill her self tonight and I don’t know what I can do or say to stop it, since she won’t talk to me anymore. Someone please help guide me to what to say or to someone who can help. Thank you.  UPDATE: she tried talking to her parents and her mom “slapped her harshly”.  UPDATE 2: she told me she was going to try to kill herself earlier and wants to cut herself / drink away her feelings"	sw

"I'm so lost. Help me please. I don't know if I can do this anymore. I've completely ruined my whole damn life.  Almost 2 months ago I broke off the engagement with my ex who I was with for 18 months, and now I hooked up with a girl and her and I were together for 3 weeks and I loved the sex and the relationship. But alas, I couldn't stop thinking of my ex.  Well her and I broke up last Friday, and right after her and I broke up, I went and slept with my ex. Now I don't know what I want. I have 2 girls who really want me, and I don't know who would be better for me. I feel something for both of me. And I'm getting pressured into making a decision.  I stopped taking my anxiety meds because they made me want to harm myself even more than I already do. I just don't want to wake up anymore. I don't want to do anything anymore. I find myself skipping class, and I'm supposed to graduate with my degree this semester and I'm fucking everything up.  This isn't me, and I don't know how to find myself anymore, and I just can't take this. I hate myself. I hate looking in the mirror. I was hurt by my ex, but I keep thinking what if shes changing for the better and I can be happy. But then I have people telling me that the other girl is better for me, and not to go back to my ex.  I care so much what other people say/think and I absolutely hate hurting people. And in this situation someone has to get hurt whether its my ex or this new girl. God, I really hate this so damn much.  I tried hurting myself the other, all I could do was hold the knife up against me but I couldn't go through with actually doing anything. I want to feel physical pain because that's better than the mental pain I'm going through.   I'm so stressed and it eels like there is no ending to this train wreck. Someone help me please."	sw
"I'll never forget this man I never met A few days ago my girlfriend was on her way to the hospital to say goodbye to the woman who raised her. It'd been a highly emotional couple of days since the decision was to remove critical life support and let her pass on. So I can only imagine how exhausted my girlfriend was after spending all of the previous day (and most of the evening) by her mother's bedside and then going into work the very next day. She's very strong and hides it well but I know she was hurting when she left work in the early afternoon. On the way to the hospital she stopped by to get a sandwich for lunch. Being the sweetheart she is, she called me up at school to take my order as well. I remember being very happy to hear she was getting food. It's so easy to forget to eat when you're sick to your stomach with grief.   Unfortunately after placing her order, her payment wouldn't go through and she was resigned to leaving empty handed. But sitting down eating his lunch, was an observant bus driver. I don't know if he paid for the meal because he could see how upset she was or if it was just another good deed he performed throughout the day. Either way it doesn't really matter why he did, because whether he knows it or not, the compassion he showed came during one of the hardest days of her life. I will forever be grateful to this person who stepped up and cared for my girlfriend. During the darkest day, he was a source of light. A reminder of the love and humanity she received from her mother. Less than two hours after this act of kindness, her mother passed peacefully with with my girlfriend by her side. It's been a long and hard weekend, and she is still grieving but as the memories of her mother will live on forever with her, so too will the actions of this man who saw a fellow human being in need. I doubt he will ever realize how much his actions meant that day but I know, I will never forget this man I never met."	cc
"Better off dead than sober [xpost from r/stopdrinking] The title should say it all. My fiancée thinks drinking is no good for me, but after I gave up benzos and opiates, booze is the only thing that keeps me from killing myself.  ""Oh, but there's so much life has to offer! Sobriety is freeing!""  ...  For me, it's really not. I have so much social anxiety, that even with an advanced degree, all I can manage to hold down is a minimum wage job that is so stressful that I'd rather be dead than continue working where I am. I've literally tried jumping into and hiding in a cardboard baler, hoping that someone would turn it on and crush me.  What is there to enjoy from being sober? I'm better off dead than living the rest of my life in this state."	sw
"I just don't get it What's so good about being alive? Why are you all trying so hard to keep others alive? Why should they, and myself, have to keep suffering.  Not everyone has good lives. Not everyone has people that care. I don't know if I can remember a time I've felt loved, and I'm more than positive others haven't ever been loved.  Everyone says these problems can be solved. It's a permanent solution to temporary issues. But is 20, 30, 40 years really all that temporary?  I tried living my life for others because I hate myself and humanity, but wanted to find counter examples. I wanted to be proven wrong. I was and wasn't. People aren't evil, just self-centered and apathetic.  So I stopped dedicating my life solely to others and tried to fix myself. Therapy and meds weren't my solution, after years of trying cocktails of SSRI/SNRIs and too many therapists to count. None of that worked and im left with 2 options. ECT and experimental treatments, which won't be covered by insurance.  I'm not broken, I was just born to be depressed. Please let me leave this cold uncaring world on my terms. I'm tired."	sw

"Become very apathetic in the past year. Hi!  Twenty years old. Young, you don't have to remind me. People do all the time, haha.  These past years have been very well to me. I have soared in my studies to the point of gaining work in my industry before having graduated college. Family's fine. I'm happy in my work; very passionate.   Through my entire life I've been extremely anxious. Middle school, high school, college... everything's been tightly strung. I've wanted to die in the past for those reasons but stress has kept me through it; no time to think about it.    Now, I've reached a point of certainty of success. There's no doubt I'll flying higher through the years to come if I keep the same effort I've had to this point. Everything's become unwound but I guess my mind hasn't.   People (friends and peers) have come to respect me and love me. I try my best to be positive and nice through all situations, and found myself close to a lot of people. Far more than my inner introvert would have guessed.    I'm finding some odd peace that I ""made it"". and don't want to stick around to see the rest. Why would I? I'm feeling okay with that work being wasted to get here. This specific point is quite literally all I've been fighting to get to the past eight years.  Everything is starting to come in. I've been really out of it lately. People have been starting to pull me aside and ask what's wrong one-by-one.   The only thing making me really hesitate is the countless that'd be really, *really* hurt if I died. Though I'm unsure how much longer that'll keep me onboard.   Feels odd asking about this at all. I don't have any apparent external forces or dread pulling me out of it. But I'm feeling pretty damn sure that an attempt will be made after I complete a promised favour mid-April. Hm.

Well, she wanted a child, and thus had me! At 3yrs old, I lost my mother to her battle of heart disease and have lived a shitty life since!!! I had an abusive stepmother, with a jealous streak! My father was no better and at age 12 I went to live with my grandmother. Every decision I've made since has caused me sadness, loneliness, anger, and grief. The only good thing out of my life are my 3 children. And to this day, I don't know what to do. I'm 44yrs old, and wish I could grab my mother by her shoulders and shake her!! And ask her why she would do this to me!! Leave me in this place called a world to suffer!!! Why couldn't she have listened to the Dr and not had children!!

"I'm lost and alone This weekend I was in a cottage with a bunch of friends from school, I have been feeling horrible for a few months now and didn't know what to do  When I was a kid I was bullied and betrayed by my friends, it has made it difficult for me to trust others, and hard to believe people want me around, I always doubt myself when someone compliments me and I never believe anyone who tells me nice things  All of a sudden, a bunch of feelings and issues I thought I had worked through in my childhood have come back, I'm scared and feel alone, I feel like I don't matter and people would be better off without me, this saturday, on the 7th of April, I was in the cottage shower, I sat down on the shower floor, took the shower head, wrapped it around my throat and leaned forward, my throat was tightened, I was getting red and blue, I felt like my eyes were popping out of my socket, then someone came in, and saw me almost lifeless, he was scared and was with me for 2 hours in the bathroom talking me out of what I was doing, the aftermath sucked, i tried to find a place to be alone to recover from what I just did, but the hardest thing was I felt horrible for making that guy come up to me in this state, later on he came to me and we cried our eyes out, the regret I got from what I had done was impeccable, he told his girlfriend what happened, which is fine, and one person walked in on us talking so he knows, in total, only 3-4 people know what happened in the bathroom, everyone else believes I was shitface drunk and vomiting all over the room  this is the first day of school after the incident, I want to go home, I want to be alone and stop bothering everyone, I wanna be open and talk about this with people, but I can't bring myself to do it, I can't continue like this"	sw

"I’m resenting my parents I’m 15, male, and I’m (guess what?) suicidal. Shocker, I know. Saying that I’m on this subreddit it’s pretty obvious.  I’ve recently unsuppressed memories of my neighbor tying me up and raping me. It took me a month to come to terms and tell my parents and when I did they said I was being over dramatic and because we were kids it didn’t count as rape. It was just “discovery” and every child does it but I promise you this was not ordinary discovery. I’ve heard of people just being curious so they ask their friend if they can see their genitals but this was nothing like that.  After I told them I was suicidal they said I was being a coward. That that was a selfish thing to think about and gave me a rant saying how hard it was when my cousin killed him self. That just made me feel shittier. They’ve gone through stuff very similar to what I’m doing and are expecting me to react in the same way.  I’ve looked up to my parents for years. Always told them everything. Now I feel like their love is holding me back. I know many people who care about me which makes me feel shittier for wanting to kill myself. It doesn’t help that I was followed home and assaulted a few months ago either. That’s just added to it all. I’m not allowed to say rape or depression in my house."	sw

"Have you ever heard of a disapointment room? Almost six years ago now I bought a really old farmhouse and about five acres of land. My three young granddaughters lived with me and it was a great rural place for them to have animals and get out to play. There's a room just off the bathroom that oddly had a door that only locked from the bathroom, and one window that is just a single pane of glass, it doesn't open. I thought it was odd, it wasn't a pantry or closet, no poles for clothes, no shelves for canned foods. Just big enough for a bedroom set.  But who would want to sleep back there in case of fire?  I took the door down, I didn't want anyone locked in back there.    A couple nights ago my granddaughter's boyfriend asked to use the rest room. She showed him where it is. I heard him say ""Wait outside the door, it's spooky in here."" Then loudly, incredulously he called out, ""Oh my God!  There's a room back here where there shouldn't be a room!  THERE'S A BED IN IT!!""  I heard her tell him it's a disapointment room.  I laughed and said yeah I guess it would be disappointing to get stuck with that one.

I feel hopeless sometimes, a failure.   I've never had someone on the regular around to talk to, or a hand to hold. I don't have anything in common with my parents, and I won't talk to them. I feel like my friends are fake. Don't even bother asking me if I've had a girlfriend.  Music is the only reason I'm here. If you know, or have felt that ""Wow, life is incredible"" feeling, nothing else gives me it. Whether I'm at home, lying on my bed, listening to my absolute favourite album of all time shutting out the rest of my surroundings (Porter Robinson's Worlds) or at the front row at a concert in absolute euphoria, it always seems to pull me from the pain.  Can anyone relate?  "	sw
"Why even exist? I can't do thing fucking right and I'm mentally retarded. I hate the way I look, react and everything else I have been born with. I hate my fucking life, I have no damn friends I talk with and I can't ever get out and socialize. What is fucking wrong with me, can't even go one place without fucking up something or bitched at. I can't stand fucking people anymore, all they do is hurt, hurt and hurt you even more. This world is a big fuck up anyways, people don't care for each other at all. We all die anyways so why don't I just end myself off so I can stop using resources others need."	sw
"As a high school student, am I missing out on anything by not partying? In all seriousness, I am a sophomore male and I have had straight A’s and been a “model” student for a while. I recently became friends with an upperclassman girl who said I was boring and was missing out on fun by not partying/drinking. Am I really missing out? I have all the resources available to party, I would be able to get to them, I just don’t know if it is worth it. What do you guys think? (based off of personal experience, etc.)  Edit : This is very important. EVERY SINGLE GUY ON MY MOM’S SIDE OF THE FAMILY WAS AN ALCOHOLIC. Having already gotten addicted to biting my nails once this terrifies the shit out of me."	cc
"It's so easy Here's what I've been looking at today:  - Downloading Tor, 1 minute - Finding a darknet marketplace, 1 minute - Creating an account, 30 seconds - Wiring cryptocurrencies, 30 minutes - Shipping heroin, 2 - 4 days - Intramuscular injection of lethal dose, 10 minutes - Delay before effect, 5 - 8 minutes  I even wrote down a couple things people will need to clean after me such as preferred charities for donations, people who knew me best for understanding, passwords for clearing my bank accounts...  The path seems so simple."	sw
"Turned in a stolen wallet after witnessing the crime The title pretty much says it all. I was walking home from a late night class (literally like an hour ago) when I see this kid bend down and drop something real quick before running away. I walk over and see that it’s a wallet.   I don’t know what to do so I’m calling and texting people about it and my one friend meets me at the scene. I take a picture of the wallet up close and then far away to get the road sign in. The owner’s ID is inside but we can’t find her on Facebook. We notice cameras are nearby so that’s good for footage of the crime.   We decide to head to Dunkin to get warm while we call the police when lo and behold, four policemen are sitting at a table at Dunkin (how ironic...). We walk up to them and tell them what happened, what the perp looked like. I showed them the picture. The police officer laughed at how thorough I was and we went on our way.   Person who go their wallet stolen from them, I hope you get it back!!"	cc
"Done?. I think I've reached my limit. I've said those words before, things have turned around before... Things are just different now.

My significant other doesn't seem to care. My co-workers all think I'm happy. This mask I wear everyday is wearing thin and I'm tired. I should have ended it in high school. 23 years is a good life right? "	sw
"What do you need? So, as the title says, what do you need? Do you need something emotional, like an emotion, a hug, a pat on the back, a nap, a friend?

"I love producing music so much but the style I’m going for on this tack is insanely tedious. Anyone up for a chat? Hey all,  So instead of doing my assignment due in two weeks I figured I might express my current emotion and produce some music. The genre is LoFi Hip Hop and I decided to, instead of writing my own chords, chop up a piano sample.   This is the first time I’ve ever chopped a sample up and it’s tedious and time consuming but sounds exactly the way I want. Thinking it might be the best track I’ve made... who knows. Can anyone relate?  What’s something you guys love doing but sometimes it just grinds your gears???"	cc

"Have you ever gotten revenge on someone you dislike? Hey all,  Wanted to share a little revenge plan that was completed today. Essentially, there’s this guy at uni who’s studying the same degree as me (although, only doing it because he “had to study something”).  Back in later stages of high school there was this group that hated me and made my life pretty shitty. This guy is part of that group and it’s obvious I’m only his “mate” in uni because he doesn’t make any other friends.   He’s in one of my classes and part of a group assignment in that class. On Friday, I asked a question to get his input on something relating to the assignment. He gave me a smart ass remark which annoyed me because I was being serious and he didn’t invest.   So now for the revenge. Basically, now he made it completely on my wrong side. And if you’re on my wrong side it’s best you cut me from your life because it’s not a place to be. Last semester I still spoke to him about uni and I guess kept him up to date with assignments and whatnot. But I didn’t.   Today we had a statistics exam, normally I would’ve been like “hey bro, you ready for stats?”. Just to be nice, because I know he’s lazy and I’m generally a nice person. But I didn’t, I knew he’d forget and he did :) so now next time I see him; “how was stats man?”. It’ll completely make him question him being there at uni because stats isn’t easy for him at all.   I’m happy with how this went :) "	cc
"I’m having a good day! I ended up going to a party a few nights ago with a couple friends. I think we all got close to blackout drunk and ended up playing truth or dare.  Long story short I ended up getting my first kiss! Even though it was through a dare it was still pretty cool. It wasn’t exactly what I expected, maybe cause I was drunk but still neat.

"Recovering addict. No reason to live. After abusing fentanyl through my teens and being unable to count on my hands the number of overdoses ive had Im still here. Why? I got on the methadone program to save my life and have been on it for a year and its just sucked the life from my body. I tried NA. Did well in it but ended up with enemies with everyone there. I have no old friends because they're all users or are from a long time ago like grade 9 and it would be weird to contact them. I'm basically lonely and done feeling like a zombie. Life is a chore. I tried to kill myself earlier last month by taking enough xanax to fall asleep in the snow, only to be found hours later with severe frostbite. A month later im out of the hospital and i tried to cut open an artery. I wasn't very successful as they released me and I'm here today. But tomorrow morning i get 7 methadone bottles and i have 100 xanax. It would be a peaceful way to go. And wouldnt fail this time. Just a final goodbye to whoever cares enough to read this Luv u mandy"	sw

"16 and depressed and wanting to kill myself on my birthday Log in / Register r/SuicideWatch 16 and hopeless u/SilentTears0 Im 16 in 11th grade and i feel like i have nowhere to go in life. I take 2 AP courses both of which I suck so bad at. Even my regular classes are tough to me.so I had to drop out to just escape the sad cruel reality.. I feel like im just a dumb retard sometimes that i cant even understand basic math or even what the teacher is telling me. no matter how hard i study i always get simple mistakes and even looking at the people who fool around in class they always get higher grades. even my friends who always complain that theyre gonna ""fail"" and that they did so ""bad"" in the end get 90 or high 80s and then theres me with the 70s and 60s. Even at home my parents hate each other its just constant argueing and im not allowed any privacy. I barely have any friends because its hard for me to socialize and talk to people. Im scared for my SAT cause i suck so much at math and now i feel like i dont even deserve to go to college. all my cousins and aunts and uncles do so well in their education and they achieve so much and even my brother is the complete opposite of me. Hes so intelligent, naturally intelligent, and he has a lot of friends. Its like i was born the black sheep. I have a dream job but that job is hard to get because its in the medical field and highly competitive so now im even questioning whats the point of living my life anymore what is even my purpose. im not smart, cant socialize, i really dont have anything i can say that im proud of. I feel like im ruining my life. Its not only my academic life its just me in general. I feel like i was born with a mental illness that makes me incapable of talking to people. Even striking up a conversation and keeping it going is such a hard challenge for me that comes so naturally to most normal people. Thats why i barely have any friends and people think theres something wrong with me cause they always see me alone. And my its my family too. I grew up with a dad that has anger issues and fits of rage. I have really bad memories of that and sometimes it comes back in episodes and i have to lock myself in a bathroom to cry. And my sister before she left for college all she did was put me down. Everysingle word that came out of my mouth he would criticize it and nobody would do anything about it. It was like that for 3 years straight. Its funny how people always say ""im always there for you"" when they never are.Now i dont know whats the point anymore of my life. Sometimes i think of suicide i never consider it but i just think of it. Sometimes i space out in class and feel like to go somewhere alone to cry. Most of the time i feel this emptiness and loneliness. I can never even stand up for myself. Even if i get bullied or someone says something about me thats not true i can never stand up. I hate myself for that. That im just this quiet passive girl who cant get directly mad at people. In my head i always say so much stuff to the people that did me wrong but when it comes to real i just say ""its okay"". Why cant i ever say what im feeling? I know why. Its cause im scared of losing the few friends i have. I always happen to piss people off and when they get mad at me even if its unfair i always try to blame it on myself and understand them because im too scared that if i say anything theyll get even more mad and stop being my friend. I guess this is the life i have to live as a socially awkward introvert who anyone can step on all they want. And i do have one talent that i was born with and its drawing. I always drew. I love singing I sing my feelings but now its always sad songs Am i depressed? I dont know because its not like im feeling depressed throughout the whole day but i dont feel happy either."	sw
"The real world finally caught up to me. I'm 21 and I've been depressed my entire life. I literally can't remember a time when I wasn't depressed - I've been having suicidal ideation since I was in the second grade. I've never been able to hold a job, and I'm going to therapy now, but it's a slow process.   My family supports me financially, but not emotionally. My dad left me a long letter today detailing how he won't continue allowing me to live in his house without paying for things, and I just want to go to sleep and never wake up.  I've tried to hold jobs, but always ended up quitting or freaking out on the first day.

"Where do you want to live? Where should I live? Hi, three years ago I left my hometown and moved 1000 miles away to Seattle. I like the rain, mountains, fog, trees, *trees*, and beer. But the area is unaffordable and crowded. Someday soon I'll move far away, again. Do you have any recommendations? I'd like to live somewhere with a similar amount of nature, preferably more mountainous and less urban, but still with reasonable amenities (fast internet for example, I need that shit)  Also, what kind of place do *you* want to eventually move to someday? What is your dream town like? Warm weather? Beaches? Or cold and mountainous? Why?"	cc
"Free shipping is kinda mislabeling You're always paying for the shipping. If it's ""Free"" then in actuality it's just added to the price of the product. Shipping has to be paid, and with your money. The only exception is subscription services, where you pay a monthly fee. But, the thing is, if the average amazon customer, for example, spends more than $10 a month (cost of prime subscription) in ""free"" shipping... that cost, once again, has to be paid with money from sales.  Idk why I'm writing this I just get a little irritated when people are excited about free shipping. Nothing is free, you're just paying for it in a more roundabout way. In the end the shipping fee has to be paid with the vendors money, which they make off of you. That means higher expenses for the vendor which means they need to charge more to stay afloat."	cc

"Am I just kidding myself? I think I've hit one of my lowest points yet, but if I had to give reasons for it, they would all come out in a garbled, incomprehensible mess. Reasoning through my issues isn't helping very much, either.  I guess a little background might help. I'm 28 and married, and I have a little girl. Not too long ago I was in graduate school for school psychology, but the pressure of that program was so intense, and they frankly didn't know what to do with me. I'm hard of hearing, deeply depressed, and have struggled for over half my life with intense OCD tendencies and high anxiety... All of this translated into a clumsy, humiliating few years in grad school, and it felt like every kind of embarrassment I could suffer, I did.  After another person in my program committed suicide, I took it as an exit call. I collected a useless Master's degree and left.   Now I've taken a much lower-paying job locally, and more often than not, I flounder at it. Sometimes I think I'm inherently not good enough, other times I feel like I've failed everyone, and I'm not up to standards even when I'm feeling less depressed. It's never been more clear to me that I'm immature, moody, have no useful talents, and am not nearly as smart as I make myself out to be. And I genuinely don't believe it when people tell me otherwise. What is there to be happy about when you really think you have no worth?   How many times can I mess up before I have to recognize that I'm not worth anyone's time? How long do I have to stumble all over myself to realize I'm not useful? And does my daughter really deserve to have such a loser for a father? Doesn't my wife deserve much better than what she has with me?  These are the questions that I ask myself every day, in-between thinking about all my worst and stupidest moments, and planning the least intrusive way to end my life.   Sometimes, I wish it was obvious that no one cared about or valued me. I wouldn't have to think about any of this, I'd just kill myself quickly and stop my bitching... Instead I have to think about what it would do to the people I leave behind. I know it's delusional to think they'll ""get over it"". But I also can't see a future where anything gets better. It feels like nothing has been truly ""better"" for years..."	sw
"I hate myself and want to die I fucked up big time.  My BF is pretty much don with me after seven years of borderline bullshit.  I've been drunk for a week.  I don't have any will to live.

Is it better to live as a monster or to die as a good person?  Edit: I'm not dead, obv. Still feel like shit, but talked to my therapist.

"Hurting those who care about me has stopped being a deterrent. No immediate suicide plans, as I’m still thinking about things, but I’ve come to realize that one of my biggest deterrents is gone. In the past, there was always just, I don’t want to hurt my few friends or my few family members that I care about. I lived through my dad’s suicide, so I know it sucks to deal with. But instead, now, part of me wants to hurt people. I want people who said they cared but couldn’t be bothered to even say hi sometimes without me needing to throw a depressive fit first to feel horrible. I just really can’t care how bad of a person that makes me. It won’t even help to put this out there and yet again nobody will care, but I’m just sick of all this shit and it’s sapped any compassion I may have had left."	sw

"Lost in life with no career prospect and in need of career guidance I am a 22 year old college graduate living in somewhere in Asia (don't ask me for a specific country) with a degree in Information Technology. I have no passion in tech and only went into tech course because it was easy to get as my high school grades were poor. To make matters worse, there are no job opportunities in the industry over here, everyone who studied Computer Science, Information Technology or whatever courses related to tech have left the country to get a job in the tech industry overseas. The rest who managed to land a job in the tech industry over here are treated as wage slaves. Seeing people living in the states mentioning soft developer is a cushy 9-5 job on Reddit just blows my mind. Never thought jobs like these could even exist in the world.   I am currently working in a low paying helpdesk job and I hated every moment of my job. In fact I never liked the tech industry in the first place and working in the helpdesk have fueled my hatred for tech even more. Don't think I will ever go back into tech.  I am stuck with my degree and have no where to go right now. I have no idea what other career field I am interested in. And even if I do, I don't think I will be able to afford for college again.

"I’m dreaming about killing my self I don’t know why. There’s no reason for me to be suicidal right now. The only problems in my life are of my own creation. I put off my work and procrastinated and missed a few deadlines and let some people down, but no one is mad at me. No is disappointed and saying that I did anything terribly wrong.  I’m upset with myself on a cognitive level but I don’t feel upset with myself. I don’t feel anything actually. I just feel numb. And I can’t do anything. Anything that requires more movements than my thumbs. Settling up this account seemed like much.  I google how to kill myself and think about it, how I want my lifeless body to be found and for my problems to all disappear. I wish I could just fall asleep and never wake up. My head feels cloudy and foggy and I just want to sleep and when I finally do I wake up feeling more tired than ever.  I feel like I don’t belong anywhere that my current life is meaningless that I just want to move on and that death would be the easiest way forward.  I think it’s stupid but also it just seems to make perfect sense. I don’t know what to do. I want to talk to someone about this but I don’t have anyone. Like I said I don’t belong anywhere or to anyone. All I had was the responsibilities and obligations that I made and now that I can’t maintain those I have no more value and no more meaning. No ones calling me and asking about me. They want to know why I can’t provide what I said I would. If I’m gone that’s all they’ll care about, the services I could’ve provided. Me, I’ve no inherent value. I feel so tired thinking about this. The struggle to be needed and wanted and cared for. I worked so hard, and I got nothing and now I can’t try anymore and I still have nothing so where else am I supposed to go? I have money and comfort and safety and the basic needs are taken care of but it’s all so empty and meaningless.  I’ve tried buying things that I thought would make me feel some kind of joy, but it hasn’t helped and now I feel like enough is enough and I just want it all to be over.  I want to wake up with some sort of desire or hope, or I don’t want to wake up at all.  If there’s anyone out there I just want to know that these words can be seen"	sw

"Do you guys know about ASMR? It stands for Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response and is a great way to relieve stress and anxiety.  It's very popular on YouTube.  I find myself using it to keep me focused and calm at work whilst I'm doing menial tasks.  Have you ever heard of it? If yes, which ASMR content creators on YouTube do you watch? :)"	cc
"I've really done it this time I'm 18 and a senior in high school. Diagnosed depression and ADHD. Both are really bad (one because of the other). I'm taking college classes full time as a high school student and am accepted into the best college in the state, as well as having the Bright Futures scholarship (specific to Florida) and financial support from voc rehab (due to aforementioned ADHD/depression). That's  $50,000 of free money and I was due to graduate with my Associates at the same time I was supposed to graduate with my high school diploma.  It's less than 3 weeks until the end of the school year. I haven't been able to keep up with the work. ADHD too severe. Zeros on pretty much everything. I have an F in one of the courses I need to graduate high school and to get my AA. If I can keep up with the rest of the work for the semester, I can scrape by with a D. I'm an A student. Things have never been this bad. I'm not stupid, my standardized test scores are near perfect. I just can't do the work. With a D, I'll graduate high school, but won't get my AA. I've emailed the professor begging her to open up some late assignments so I can get partial credit. She declined. Trying to get the adaptive services to butter her up, and they'll try, but they admit there's really nothing they can do at this point.  I'll most likely get the D, most likely have to take a summer course to finish my AA, but I'll lose my acceptance into the college of my dreams. I was planning on moving into a house with my friends and my girlfriend since we were all going to the same college. But my parents aren't going to pay for me to live and go to community college up in that college town anymore now that I'm a failure, not that I want to go to the community college anyway but my mom is crazy and emotionally manipulative and I need to get out of my house. That $50,000? Going to be gone. I can't pay for college. If I reapply for Bright Futures or that college, they'll see the D and deny me. My girlfriends mental health is also precarious and she's depending on me to go and move in with her. I can't NOT move in with her, but I won't be able to attend or afford college.  Everything is ruined. Besides the actual logistics of everything, what remains of my pride is shattered. I didn't have much to cling on to, I was that ""gifted"" kid who was given an inflated sense of self worth but no means on surviving in the real world. My ADHD had kept me from being successful in every aspect of my life, but at least I had academic success and was relatively intellectual. Apparently not anymore. There was so little expected of me, ""just make it through one more semester of high school."" Couldn't do it. Nobody understands what it's like to live with ADHD like mine. ""Oh just pay more attention."" Nevermind that it's turned me into a vegetable who can barely take care of my own hygeine.  My options are limited. Slim to no chance I'm going to get a C in that class. So I'll lose the acceptance and the scholarships. I can stay and live with my mentally ill mother and do classes locally, while my future with my girlfriend falls apart, and I eventually kill myself. I can move in with my friends, forget about college, forget about my dreams, become a wage slave, and eventually I'll kill myself. I could  move up and go to college anyway, racking up tens of thousands of dollars worth of debt, and eventually kill myself. Or, I could just save myself the trouble and kill myself now.  It used to be that the only thing holding me back was my love for my dad, but I'm just a disappointment to him now, so I can't let him down much more than I already have.  "	sw
"Drugs and depression don’t mix All I ever heard from my friends was that you can’t get addicted to weed. If you believe this, that’s fine, but if you find that you relate to a lot of posts in this sub I hope you listen. I found that when I smoked I was able to escape my anxiety and depression for the night. It was really nice, and I started doing it every weekend. Then, my work would pile up or I’d have a fight with a friend and I’d smoke on a weeknight.   I’ll be honest with you - it worked for a while. I started to enjoy life more and I started to get really interested in mountain climbing. I kept this up, and I became more social. Things were going well, and I just kept smoking. Eventually, I went on spring break and didn’t smoke the entire time (because I couldn’t bring anything on the plane). This is where things started to go downhill.   Over the break, I had multiple mental breakdowns the likes of which I had never experienced. At my lowest I remember crying in my car so hard that I was literally screaming unintelligibly. Thoughts filled my head of driving my truck off a bridge. I hadn’t thought like this in a while, though I have always battled depression.   When I got back from break I smoked immediately, and I felt better. To make sure I had fixed myself, I smoked the next day. And the next day. And the day after that. Before I knew it I was getting high three times a day.   Not only did my use increase, the effects began to change. Whenever I smoked, I felt like I was a total failure that had nothing going for me. It was like my intrusive thoughts of self loathing had finally figured out how to get into my high mind, and they didn’t leave very easily. I had terrifying dreams sometimes, too. I had a recurring one of me falling off of a mountain, which really killed my newfound enthusiasm for climbing.   I went on a trip with my friend to a different part of my state today. He’s in the military so I didn’t bring any of my smoking stuff, because I was gonna be around him and other military members that can’t smoke anyways (they get drug tested).   The anxiety attack came as scheduled. It felt like something terrible was going to happen, but I didn’t know what. I was shaking and I couldn’t stop fidgeting. I was able to hold it together on the outside but I lost control of my emotions. I texted my best friend a few states away and said some terrible things to her. Still, I don’t even understand it. She told me that she had been smoking and it’s like a switch was flipped in my brain. It was like I hated her immediately. I told her she was a bad friend and I was sick of talking to her. I still don’t understand it. I don’t feel that way, and I don’t know why I did what I did. Luckily, she’s a strong person and things will be fine between us, but I legitimately thought about killing myself over this. Not going to lie, writing it down really helps though.   I don’t feel like the same person anymore. Smoking doesn’t give me the relief that it used to, and whenever I stop I get worse than I ever was before I started this stupid habit.   I’m not going to demonize people that like to smoke... I know a lot of folks can handle it better than me.   But please, don’t make the same mistake I did. Substances won’t cure you. They will just make your mental illness go away for a little while and come back with a vengeance.   Having tried some other drugs, I’m making a decision now to cut all of it out of my life before I become dependent on something that will really screw up my health. I know that my problems are pretty small compared to some on this sub, but if sharing my experience helps one person steer clear of this path then I will be glad I took the time to write this. I hope you all find yourselves. "	sw
"I've made my plans, not today though. I've been planning my last day for a little over 2 months now. August 9th, I get paid that day so that makes my plans a little bit easier. I'm going to go to DC, watch a baseball game, eat barbecue for dinner, play chess with the hustlers at DuPont Circle, and then I will put a bullet in my head somewhere off of the highway late at night so even if I survive, I'll just bleed out before anyone can get to me. I'm pretty excited for it, truth be told.   It kind of really started when my kid's mom took him out of town on my birthday, so I didn't even get to see him, and honestly, he is the only reason I have been getting out of bed for the past 2 years. I've lost my ex, which hurts a lot, but I'm not going to off myself over that. However, She has been systematically reducing the time I spend with him and implanting him with ideas that I am a bad person that he should be fearful of. We still live together, but that's about to change and I'm going to be relegated to backseat/part-time maybe 2 days a week having to watch someone else raise my kid. Eventually he will come to loathe the days he has to be with my sad and pathetic existence within my miserable apartment so it's best I do this before he can formulate any real memories of me. Well that's my tale, or at least the parts I could organize and put down.   If anyone has read this, and want to help, first of all thank you, but I encourage you to help those who have more immediate needs. I know that I've tried to help some people on this sub, and I hope you don't think I'm hypocritical for being this way. "	sw
"I truly want to die I feel like its the only way to release all the unhappiness inside me. I havent been happy in at least 6 months. The odd part is that there is nothing wrong with my life. My family is nice, we are fairly well off and i have never really faced any large societal issues. But here i am unhappy and considering suicide. Millions of people want the life i have and would do nearly anything to get it. But here i am ready to end it. My life could be amazing. I am decently smart so i could get a decent job.  But instead i waste my time playing fuckin video games because i dont care what happens anyways. I havent been happy in so long. I just want this bullshit to end   Tldr: its not where i live Its not who i live with  Its not my school Its not my peers It is me i am a miserable sack of shit "	sw
"Missed probably the last chance in my life to end it all The title sounds wholesome but this is actually a huge dilemma for me lol. Since a child I just lived every day like it was my last because I really didn't know when I was going to snap and try to commit suicide. I'm /r/raisedbynarcissists so I knew life wasn't shit since before I was 10. When I entered adulthood I manifested dpdr for a while, one of the most extremely horrific things that any human being can go through, I tried ending my own life back then but I woke up to another miserable day as you can see.     Now that I've gone through probably the worst thing that'll ever happen to me, it feels like I have a reason to be in this world knowing no matter what happens it won't be as bad as round-the-clock torture. I can't live the way I used to, I never saw myself being alive for decades. When I expected death I enjoyed things so much more, but everything can't be pointless when you're forced to live."	sw

I cackle  At the fact that   No matter how long I starve myself  I'll never be thin enough  So I poke fun at my size  ""I'm the jolly green giant"" I say  All this hooting   All this hollering  And still  No one   Absolutely no one  Can hear my cries  Why  Because  I  Am too busy  Laughing out Loud"	sw
"I Am Truly And Finally Sick of This Bullshit Called Life, I've Tried Everything And It Doesn't Get Better I'm literally sitting here crying writing this. I'm a failure, a worthless and useless person that nobody cares about. I've done everything people told me and suggested. I started eating healthy, started working out/doing sports, I made a healthy daily routine, I do Nofap, I'm doing everything that makes my life better, but it doesn't I'm still the fuckin' lonely guy who is a failure.  The girl I like doesn't care about me. We would have a date today, but she cancelled saying some fake shit why we can't meet. She said she is going to write me later, but she didn't. She doesn't fuckin' care about me and what I feel. I already confessed to her how I feel and she seemed to feel the same way, but I believe it was also fake shit. I don't feel like writing her, because she just doesn't fuckin' care. I'm not going to beg for anyone's attention I would rather die and that's what I'm going to do today. Just have to figure out how I'm doing it. It's not the first time girls rejected me. Every time I asked a girl out they rejected me.   People doesn't fuckin' care about anyone beside themselves they are all filthy scum of earth.   My friends? Do I have any? Well, I used to. Some of the moved away. Others are with their girlfriends 24/7 and doesn't fuckin' care about the guy who actually got them together. They didn't even bother sending a happy birthday text. What does it take? Like 5 seconds? Yes, but that's how much they doesn't fuckin' care. They don't even know I exist I suppose. One friend I lost to suicide. Another friend is always busy. I'm so fuckin' lonely and sick of living. I see no point. Next year I'm going to university, but I don't fuckin' care about that anymore. I want to die.  People only talk or text me if they need something, if I need something they don't reply. I'm always very friendly and help people where I can, but I get nothing. I'm sick of this.  Going to write my notes and I'll do it tonight. "	sw
"It's my first Saturday night I've had free in several weeks and I have no idea what to do with myself. Do I stay home and play video games? Do I go to a friend's house?

"welp. I discovered last week that I got into a top-choice college. It was amazing! I'd gone on a string of rejections for a while, and was really beginning to doubt myself, but to see myself get into THIS particular school... it was a euphoric feeling, to say the least.  But then I got the financial aid package.  I've pretty much accepted that I won't be attending this school. But it's a gut-punch. All of this work, and even more continual work to raise the funds, and it still won't be enough. I'll admit, I spent three days straight crying over this. It's all been for nothing. I've asked anyone if there's any sort of way short of a miracle to raise the money I need, but there really isn't. It's as if everything I've been doing these past few years of my life were just four years that I was pursuing the wrong thing.  It's just... I know this is extreme, but I've just lost a will to live. I HAVE grappled with suicidal ideation before, but never has it felt this intense before. They come and go in waves, so to speak, and usually in very stressful situations for me. I've always been able to work through it. I just get the feeling this is going to be a longer wave than usual.  Special thanks for reading my vent. I do believe I will be able to get through this as well, but at the same time I wish I'd just been rejected altogether from the school rather than accepted and unable to afford it. I'd probably have been able to move on easier, considering that this was my final decision following a string of rejections.  "	sw
"Does anyone else enjoy trying to make someone else's day better? After one of the longest and most frustrating mornings, I went to Costco to buy some dog food. As I was about to walk away, this little girl was sitting in the shopping cart trying to eat her sample of jelly beans and a he drops the whole cup. Her mom starts yelling at her since she predicted it was going to happen. I ran over to  the jelly bean samples and grabbed one to give to the little girl. The mom thanked me and I walked away hearing the little girl scream ""Thank you!"" Even when I am not having one of the best days, it really cheers me up to see someone else smile.  "	cc

"I am tired of not truly challenging myself intellectually and will be attempting to learn ASL and Psych I am a Sophomore at Sam Houston State University in Texas and i am majoring in political science.

I really want to learn sign language (ASL) but didn't want to take the classes for it because i was scared about how hard it would be (i have never taken a foreign language class) But recently i said fuck that! I have started learning the ASL alphabet and i have been practicing a couple phrases. Im not gonna let my fear of working hard stand in my way of learning something cool. Im gonna push my self intellectually for once in college!  I am a really attentive student in the class room. It's just homework that i hate.

"I just let a random kid into my house To set the scene a bit, I'm a barely adult girl, home alone and it's hailing. I see this kid outside walking home from school and he's shielding himself from the hail. ""Lol that sucks"" I think to myself.   The hail stops and turns into snow so I just go back to chilling on the couch when I see this kid start walking up my driveway ten minutes later.   My dog is barking at the front door and I contemplated not answering the door but I did anyways. The kid asks me if I have a phone charger so I grab one and let him in so he can figure out what house his girlfriend lives in.   I try to make small talk with him but I really have no idea how to talk to young people so it's super awkward. I also can't stop thinking about those black eyed children myths and wonder if I'm about to get murdered by a seventh grader.   I guess eventually he gets his girlfriends address, says thanks for the charger, and peaces out.   The strangest thing about this is that he chose to come to my house,  it doesn't even look like anyone is home. Lights are off, garage is closed, and the tv isn't even on. He didn't even ring the doorbell, just stood there waiting. I'm a bit weirded out tbh "	cc

"Family/Me ruined life, nowhere to turn Sorry for this giant wall of text. I've had a terrible relationship with my family my entire life. Since I was 5 years old I was mentally and physically abused by my older brother and my stubborn father would do nothing but encourage this by getting into verbal battles with both of us because he ruined his own life. I never had anywhere to go or anythimg to do to escape this and because of that and a genetic predisposition to it I developed all sorts of mental issues like depression, severe social and general anxiety, and was recently diagnosed with ADHD. I've always been very intelligent but unable to do anything with it or focus on homework or anything really. I pretty much used books and videogames as an escape mechanism as a kid and as I grew older music and weed took their place for the most part. I graduated from high school with around a 3.0 gpa from almost all honors and ap classes and a 30 on my ACT without ever doing homework or studying in high school. I then went to college for a semester where my depression and anxiety took over and I couldn't function in my new environment and didn't have any money for textbooks or anything and after 2 weeks I slept through my science labs and automatically failed 2 classes. I began to do nothing but sit in my room and play videogames and the only time I left was to eat and I was too anxious and dumb to seek help from a counselor at school and had nobody else to turn to. My parents had moved into a tiny 2 bedroom apartment after I graduated and I had to move back in there with them. My older brother also messed up at school and I had to share a tiny room where I had to deal with him continuing to verbally abuse me and break my things every single day. The first couple months I was back I was super depressed and had literally nowhere to go and had to share a car that was always on the brink of breaking down and constantly needing repairs with my brother. After a month or so I started working full time and a bit later moved into working full time. At this point my physical health and mental health were awful and I decided I needed to take care of those things before I did anything else. I continued to work and started going to the gym and went to the doctor for mental issues for the first time at that point. I was given a myriad of different SSRI's and they all did nothing to help but I continued to try them because I wanted to give them a chance to work. I worked and wasted almost all the money I earned on things like my cell phone bill, car insurance and repairs, weed, fast food my gym membership, videogames and paying off my 10,000 dollars in student loans. It took me about a year and a half and I had paid them off. My brother went back to school a few months before then so I didn't have to deal with him at least. Nothing I ever did was good enough for my family and my father constantly got into verbal battles with me because if I wasn't working 60 hours a week I wasn't working hard enough. Obviously this had been going on my entire life and he didn't understand he just made it worse and any time I objected he would just threaten to take my things or other dumb things. I was in constant brain fog and I couldn't function. After about 2 years of dropping out of college I decided I needed to get away from this and moved into an apartment with a couple friends. I was barely able to keep up with all my bills working basically minumum wage and went even financially every month sometimes having to draw credit card debt.   I lived there for a year and although I never had any money I was happier than I'd ever been with my family and did my best to tackle my mental health issues and went to therapy a couple of times a month and tried some different medications. I also thought about what I wanted to accomplish in life before I died and tried acid 3 times with my friends which helped me discover that music is my true passion and I started making music and got a guitar. In about april of last year I needed a new car and took out a loan for 3000 dollars for one. I didn't have the money to make payments on it however. I moved back in with my parents in September 2017 and my struggles dealing with them continued. I wanted to just live here for a bit so I could save up money and go back to school. Since then I've been working odd jobs until I get bored of one and move on as I cannot stand retail jobs.   "	sw

I have *never* left a single person who I have thought was suffering until I know I've helped them. if it's a long term problem then goddamnit I'll keep checking in on them, making sure they're ok, forever. I've been checking in on the same friend for three years, someone I barely talked to, because he seemed to be in a bad situation. I've skipped classes and labs to console friends in bad situations. So what did I do to deserve all these sympathetic passers-by's? Why do I even hate myself enough to need to fucking talk to anyone? I considered seriously killing myself a couple times so far this year. and it showed. there's zero chance people didn't know. I'm literally breaking down. I'm non functioning. my mind is frozen. my body is broken. my will has degraded to nothing. I was already a husk, so I don't know what I've become now. Dead. I'm dead. All that's left is that final, technical switch keeping me alive. so why then. why is it that even as I walk to deaths door I get stabbed in the back. by people who are like me even. what the fuck is wrong with you people. what the fuck is wrong with me.   I'm so tired. I'm so fucking tired of being sad. it's been nearly 10 years with this shit i know because i marked the anniversary of my first depressive episode. it's in 4 months. I've effectively been refused from going back to 3 therapists (think uni counselors) because they said I'm just too fucked for them, and to try to find someone else. the only people I talk to are gonna stop talking to me when I shave my head (crown thinning+manbun=nobody notices) because that's what people do. they leave when you show weakness. and then I'll go back to being alone. and I don't know if I can do that again. I can't go back to being alone after knowing them. did you know they took care or me when I was drunk? these people sat with me all night, said they loved me, gave me a place to stay and breakfast in the morning. my family wouldn't do that. but they're human, in the end. when I break down, really break down, there won't be a person who can say they didn't know. they'll leave me for someone lower maintenence. and I'm close. I'm Leonidas, walking towards Xerxes in that last scene. I've faced all the arrows and I'm still stumbling on. but there's a final volley coming, and I don't think I'm doing to survive it. I don't know what the arrow that kills me is going to look like, but it's already left the bow. better start preparing to leave a pretty corpse.   Now try to pretend you care, you depressive philistines. tell me about why I'm wrong, or why my attitude is all turned around, or why life is worth living and send over those Internet hugs that seem to mean so much to you. tell me I don't exercise enough or how going bald at 19 isn't bad. Tell me that friends don't mean anything, as long as you learn to be happy on your own. Send over that tough love^TM that simultaneously lets me know how stupid i am for feeling like this and also doesn't even try to give an alternative. Give me those same garbage coping mechanisms you give to all the broken people that post here, and pray to God that I decide not to take you up on your offer and send something to your dms, where you'll have to pretend to care for *even longer*. or maybe you won't. maybe you'll see all this hateful garbage I'm spewing and you'll decide that I'm not worth the time it takes to comment. I'm not worth your effort, to try to fix this cynical mess. I understand that. I wouldn't comment on this cesspool of a post either. the vile writings of a pouting child who comments on suicide boards, insulting the people who try to help others. I get it. and in a sense I'm sorry. but in a much more real sense, I don't care at all about how this comes across. take it how you will. comment or don't comment. delete this post or ban me. whatever. but at the end of the day, as angry and angsty as I sound, I'm right and you all know it. and shame on you if you pretend to care about people just to make yourself feel better. Happy Easter. "	sw
"Deciding which day is more appropriate My little brother has a weekly schedule to where he leaves for his dads for the week, then comes back to his moms (here). I’m going to kill myself in the bathroom but I don’t know if I want him to be here to see that, he’s here now & leaves next Wednesday. I’m ready to go now but I don’t want him to be around that once I’m finished. I don’t know what to do"	sw
"Tonight's the Night! So I've just worked out how to send a delayed message off my phone, which means I can text a friend that I've done the deed, do the deed, and they can panic and call emergency services after I'm long gone. No risk of me being saved, no need for my roommates to find a bloody corpse, and hopefully no ""what if I'd called the ambulance a minute faster""-guilt for my friend. Win win win. It was the last barrier to my suicide and now it's gone, I actually feel so relieved.  I'm not too sure why I'm posting this. It's not that I want anyone to talk me out of it, I've been working up the balls to do this for years, and if anything, I need someone to encourage me to take that final step. But I doubt I'll find that here, so moving on. I guess I just want to let it out before I go. I feel like there's gonna be a lot of shit made up after I go and even if you're the only ones who read it, I want someone to know the truth.  See, I'm 22, and I'm a law student in one of the better programs in my country, and when I go, there's going to be a whole thing about creating a better culture for students and student mental health (If they don't just ignore it altogether, which I'd honestly prefer). The thing is, I don't have any worries about the uni side of things. I find the course challenging but interesting and honestly it's about the only thing going right for me. The reason I'm going to kill myself is because I'm short, fat, relatively stupid, lonely as hell, and fuck ugly. Not a lot to it. I have a fair few friends, but there's maybe two that I'd feel alright telling this to. One of them told me she needed to focus on her own mental health and couldn't deal with being my support - completely fair, no hard feelings - and the other is going to get that text I talked about up top.  This isn't some rushed decision on my part. I've been depressed since I was 12/13 - maybe earlier, but that's when I remember first fantasising about dying. When I was 17 I realised that I could actually go ahead and kill myself, which was honestly a pretty freeing revelation. For the last five years I've been doing my best to work up the guts to end it all, and now here we are. I feel like I've given life a fair go. I've moved out, moved to a different city, even travelled a tiny bit. What's become clear to me doing all of that is that it's not a problem with my situation. It's not something that's going to get better as I go through life. The problem, as I see it, is that I'm a defective human. I have absolutely no desire to go through another 60 years feeling alone and disconnected and miserable, and ending things tonight is just convenient and easy and practical. That's basically it.  If any of my friends somehow find this and link it back to me, there's no hard feelings. There's no one big bad event that led to this. This is just the smart choice for me.   If any of you bothered reading this, thanks for the time. Hope you guys have a better life than I did."	sw
"My Ex's entire family thinks I'm a monster and think I'm a potential murderer all because I bought a gun to kill myself. Hello, I've been dealing a ton of depression my entire life and the breakup between my girlfriend and myself caused me so much depression I attempted suicide from overdosing and that failed.  Fast forward a few months later I was still dealing with a lot of stress until I finally purchased a weapon, I was talked down by a roommate when I bought a gun in my room. However, he also knew my ex and informed her. She eventually got a restraining order against me even though I've never had a criminal record, I was never violent, never made a threat of harm against her, and there was no intention of ever hurting her. I wasn't even charged with a crime.  I now can't even contact her explaining the situation and I'm still very depressed. Her entire family thinks I'm a monster and I have no one in my life. This is probably the worst moment in my entire life, I'm so lost and I don't know what to do."	sw

"I guess in the back of my mind i always wanted to be a well known musician so people would actually care if I killed myself. And now it's blatantly obvious that it's not materializing without effort, it's possible it still might happen of course. Idk why I romanticized it so much, I just wanted someone to give a shit about me. I still have a handful of followers on my SoundCloud and late last night I had a weird thought about putting out a clear ""I'm going to kill myself"" message on there somehow. I decided against it mainly because I don't think a single person would actually care, let alone do anything. Anyway, I'm going to work. I wish anyone cared who could actually help me. All my friends are multiple states away, my family is a fucking Trainwreck which I need to escape as soon as possible, and I'm chronically fucking ill and nobody fucking cares. Down a bunch of drugs and get to the next thing seems to be the same of the game."	sw
"Going downhill A couple years back I was actually kind of happy. But now that I have made my way on up to high school everything's gotten worse, and I still have no friends. Honestly I haven't had close friends since 4th grade and I hate talking to my mom because she always yells at me. My dad is better but I still don't really feel like I can talk to him.  Everything is stressing me out. My parents always want be to be the fucking best at everything and I never reach their expectations. I don't reach anyone's expectations. I don't know how to communicate well and just feel so lonely. I'm fucking sick of everything.  Especially my sister. All she does is smoke and drink. My parents don't even help her and she doesn't listen to me. She's so lazy and never does anything, yet my paarents don't give a fuck. And I get treated worse than her but I don't do anything wrong. I don't understand.   I've been thinking of ending it a lot, especially lately. The furthest I've gone is cutting. I just want someone to love me and understand me, but no one really does.

"I'm sad because the stray cat I've been feeding might not come anymore I'm actually feeding 2 strays. One of them is basically a pet now since she stays in our yard and never leaves. The other has been following me home when I head back on my walk with the dog. I don't know where she stays cause whenever I turned around she was already behind me. She's got the cutest meow and gorgeous coat too, it was pretty much love at first sight.  She's already figured out where I live and somehow my walk schedule (it's pretty inconsistent.) I like to feed them after my walk since it's more convenient, but the past 2 days she's been expecting me before I even leave the house. And when I start walking she follows me. I didn't want her to walk all that way so on the first day I picked her up, put her in my yard and *ran*.  She tried to follow me for a bit but then I cut around the corner and lost her. She wasn't there when I came back :( Same thing today. I just figured she'd wait for me.  She's a really sweet cat. I hope she comes back, I'll feed her before my walk next time."	cc
"I cannot seem to find anyone to discuss linguistics with :/ I struggled with this even in college even though we studied languages there. The only people that I could discuss linguistics with were the teachers basically. Sure there's the respective subreddit, but it's not the same thing as conversing with someone.    I love all languages and all varieties, however I do have a strong preference for Germanic languages, having had studied 4 of them to various degrees ( English C1/C2, German B2/C1, Dutch B1 and Norwegian A1/A2). I also speak Romanian and Hungarian as my native languages and have taught both of them, so if anyone wants to discuss anything related to the things I have mentioned or is curious about anything, let me know!

"Lonely and Running Out of Hope I've been depressed for several years now, and suicidal ideation isn't new for me. Recently though it's moved past ideation into thoughts that have the same theme: you aren't making it through this, and the few people who do care about you are going to be relieved if you just shut up and end it.  Over and over I tell myself my life is no longer worth living. I have a chronic illness that is painful and will most likely end in my death - not quickly or swiftly but agonizing pain that slowly ends in my loss of independent function entirely.  Because of the nature of this, because of practical matters of day to day life, all of my friendships are a pale imitation of what they once were. My family tries to help, but they lose patience quickly now and have lives of their own.  I did try talking to one of my parents about my mental state, and clearly said I was thinking of killing myself. Any response that would've helped (""I love you, please don't think that way, how can we help, let's get you some help ASAP, we care, you'd be sorely missed, talk to me."") remained unsaid, probably because they aren't true. Any of those things would've helped. A fucking hug would've helped. Anything indicating empathy, sympathy, love, caring, concern - **anything** would've helped. The response I did get was so ludicrous that it deepened my dismal hopelessness.  I don't know what to do anymore. I really don't. Part of me doesn't want to die, but it's an increasingly small part. The life I have? What's it worth? Endless pain and suffering with no one to confide in? Not much. Not much of anything."	sw

"My work basically told me that I'm wasting valuable creativity on my personal projects and I should just be doing work. All right, pointless, personal rant time.  So, my job basically just told me I'm wasting my energy and creativity working on side projects (like game development and modding) and that I should be focusing all of my effort on my real job because it ""matters"". The thing is, I don't think my job matters. What they do is important, sure, but anyone with my education could do what I do. I'm a glorified number cruncher here. That's not important. The stuff I'm working on off the clock is stuff that's truly ""mine"", and I think that makes it important.  I requested to switch to part-time because honestly this job is causing me weekly anxiety attacks and I can't stay here for eight hours a day five times a week without breaking down and I'd rather use that time to work on my own stuff. I was told that I was hired to bring that creativity to the office and that I shouldn't be wasting time on things that are ""fun"". I've then been given basically nothing but algorithms and graph traversal problems.  I may have a CS degree, but I'm not a damn calculator. I got into this field to make games, not to make security simulations. I kept this job to fund my projects, not the other way around. Even then, I've given so much effort to work that I'm often too drained to code at home. I'm still stuck here for the time being because the therapy my insurance has been paying for is what's given me the boost I've needed these past few weeks to work on my side projects, but if I find so much as a retail job with health care I'm bouncing.  I was totally content with just continuing to do my best and work on what was needed, but way to take the fuckin' wind out of my sails on that one. I've pretty much instantly lost all drive to do anything at work any more.   All my life I've been told to get a good degree to get a nice stable full-time job and buy a house and a car and a picket fence and shit, but I was legitimately happier pulling 20 hours a week at a movie theater and streaming game dev every week. I posted weekly blog updates, and while I didn't have many followers, I had some, and I liked to talk with them. I liked knowing that I, specifically, was making someone's day just a little bit better."	cc
"I had a really nice interaction with a customer today I work retail in an electronics department, so right off, you can imagine how great my job is. I love being overworked and underpaid, and abused by customers. /s  Today was more of the same all day long. I was supposed to get off work at 430, and ugh I was ready for it. I was so tired and in such a bad mood, I was counting down every minute. At around 4, this older lady came in and was looking at movies. I went over to her and did the usual ""can I help you find something"" spiel, and she started off with the usual ""no, just browsing"" thing. I said ok and told her if she needed anything, let me know. She ended up saying ok, but then started going on about how she was just looking for tv shows, she likes to collect dvds. I told her she was in the wrong aisle, and I walked her to the correct one. Then I was just being polite, and asked her what kind of shows she was looking for, and what is her favorite. She started to get really into the conversation and she was listing off all kinds of stuff, from new shows like Empire to old stuff as far back as like the original Twilight Zone. She was telling me how she doesn't have cable anymore since her husband died, she just has an antenna and loves watching all the re-runs of this or that, and also these new shows... she literally was telling me the days/times, channels, and number of episodes that come on each day for each show. Like for real, this lady is a hardcore lover of tv, especially old shows, but also several shows that surprised me when she named them. She was telling me how she sets her alarm to wake her up early specifically so she doesn't miss stuff too. Lol  Anyway, it just so happened, a few of the shows she named were ones I like too. I mentioned it, and she got really happy and we just started talking about those shows, and she said she was surprised about a few I knew too, saying she didn't think ""someone so young would even know about x, y, and z shows!"" Then she asked me if I had any suggestions, since it seems we have the same taste, so I got excited telling her about some things I had seen too. We seriously just stood there and ""compared notes"" on shows for 30 minutes. She then even went ahead and bought the complete series of one show I recommended, saying she trusted my judgement, and couldn't wait to watch it.   After that, she said she had really enjoyed talking to me, and that I had helped her a lot, then she thanked me, and she even used my name. It was nice, most people don't bother with my name or even look me in the eye, like sometimes I even wonder if people remember I'm a human being too. Anyway, she said she was going to come back soon, and she was going to find me again if she needed help, because I did a great job.  She was a complete stranger, but I really enjoyed talking to her, and she turned my mood completely around. I left work with a genuine smile on my face for once. "	cc

"I sexually committed a crime and I can’t get over it. Let me start out by saying that I came on here for support and to see what I actually did was wrong. I 100% feel like what I did was wrong, but I want other people’s opinions as well. I’m scared to tell my friends about this or even a therapist, so I decided to go on here to see if I could get some advice. Could be bad, but it’s worth a shot. I’m running out of options.  A little backstory, I’m 19, and I recently dated this girl that I used to go to school with. She moved back into town and we started talking again. Right away, I knew she was into me because she kept on dropping hints about my looks and all that. I figured, what the hell, I’ll go out with her. She is my type anyways. So we started dating and we took things at a very fast pace, which I was nervous about, but she assured me that everything was fine.   It was my birthday the next day, and she wanted me to come over and spend the night with her. I said no at first, due to the fact that it was 11 at night and I just wanted to go home and sleep. But eventually I gave in. I drove over there and we started to lay in bed and talk. I don’t know why I got so horny, but I did. So I wanted to get rid of it. With my girlfriend being right there and us already doing sexual stuff (dating for a month btw. This is the fast paced part I mentioned), I wanted to have sex. She said she wasn’t in the mood. So I went down a notch and asked her to talk dirty to me. She laughed at that fact and said no. I kept on asking her, joking with her, and eventually she gave me. I do my thing, clean up, and we talk afterwards and then sleep.   The next day, we get dressed and I leave her apartment. Throughout the day, we’re talking and then she says that she’s in big trouble. Said that something went down with her grandparents and that she is screwed. We didn’t talk for a day, so I got worried and asked her the next day if she was okay. She responded and confronted me about my sexual assault.   I first, I was shocked that I could do such a thing. I thought nothing of it, but as she told me and made me remember, it hit me like a brick wall. I started to ball my eyes out. I told my mom about what happened and she tried to reassure me that it was just a huge misunderstanding, but I knew what I did was wrong.  I apologized and everything to her. We eventually broke up and it still dawns on me everyday of what I did.   I’ve done some recent research on this topic and see what I can do to get some help for myself as I don’t want to be the same person that I am. I also see if this was an actual crime or not. Judging from what I read, it seems like it could be to me, but again, want peoples opinions on this one.   I posted it on here mostly because I saw a similar one on here and I want to die over this. I feel absolutely distraught and disgusted over myself for this.   Any advice you guys have will help me a lot, as I’m stuck at a crossroads and don’t know what to do. Thanks "	sw

"10 probably spoiled yoghurts and a broken train line. What am I? I'm upset.   So I've been on my train for the past two hours. And it's been stuck here forever, I quote ""no service for the​ foreseeable future""  Now I'm a patient guy. People tell me this, so naturally I'm not fussed. I have a playlist of music to keep me going forever and phone games.  But the yoghurts. These beautifully crafted yoghurts that I got for free near my work are most definitely spoiled and it's just sad to think about.  In the UK we have a bank holiday Friday and Monday so the start of my awesome 4 day holiday has been a traumatic one.  I'm tweeting and informing every living body of existence... As you do. And I could not miss the opportunity to let my CC fam know!  It's not all bad guys, I'm getting picked up to go home. But as I'm writing this it's been 2 hours.  Send some condolences towards my yoghurts people. I planned when to have them all but that's not going to happen now!

"Where do journals get their court records? I've been trying to find some in the Elgin, IL court. I'm a little curious, or very curious, sometimes, about how things actually happen. I was reading an article a few hours ago and I saw that they cited court documents (""according to court documents...""). I myself have translated a lot of court documents, so I know what they look like and how to read their euphemisms and weird vocabulary, but I just noticed that I don't have any idea how to find them while journalists do all the time.  Would I have to go to the court? Maybe that's one of the possibilities. But maybe there are also ways to get a copy of the cases (or certain cases) online.  It would be pretty interesting, actually, since there are many cases that have some really curious details for curious people like me."	cc
"Last time I took a personality test was a year ago. I just did a new one, and I am a changed person. So, yeah, my new result is ENFJ-A in the 16 personalities test, and that's a lot different from my first result, which was ISFJ.    It made recall how I was back then, and I realized how much I have changed, maybe for the better.    Back then, I was an introverted kid, not so many great friends. Always at the computer. It's not like I was sad at that time, it's just who I were.    But then, I travelled to Mexico (from Denmark), studying abroad and getting new friends. It felt kind of like starting over. I knew no one other than my host family and a couple of classmates, but I decided I wouldn't let that discourage me. I was starting over after all, so I decided I wanted to try not being antisocial and introverted.    I had this chance, and I took it, and I feel like I am refreshed, opened up to many new experiences. This year abroad has made me a new person. And I like me!    Now, I wonder how my family is going to receive me when I go back in a couple of months.

"Update: I took the pills, now I just need to play the waiting game I made a post earlier about waking up this morning wanting to take 25000 mg of acetaminophen. 50 extra-strength pills. I just finished taking all of them.  Now the plan is to wait it out. Hopefully I won't throw up; I know I can stomach 35 pills, but I'm not sure about 50. Now we see what happens within the next 24 hours to a week. Acute liver failure? Or is my liver so fucking resilient it'll just sustain a lot of damage? The mystery... This desire for a slow-burn suicide like this, to do all this damage to my body, is going to end up killing me, and that's kind of the point.  I just don't see a reason to live anymore. I feel like my career is in shambles, my life is crumbling, and I can't get the voice or the thoughts to stop. The only help I have gotten from professionals is a referral to group therapy with a very long wait list (up to a year), and having access to the crisis line. I feel like such a lost cause sometimes.

I’ve written suicide notes to my family, friends.  But there is one thing that bothers me, should I text my mother and tell her how I feel, about my depression, suicidal thoughts? It’s hard to do, because I’m afraid of her reaction.  Maybe she will go ultra mad and that will break me even more? On the other hand, what have I left to lose? I’ve told some people about my depression, they didn’t cared enough, and if I’ll make right now a promise to my mom that we will discuss about this at home, where are guarantees that she will care? Maybe she will think that I’m just a whiny idiot because life is hard and yada yada.   The thing is, I’m not sure that I want to die, but I don’t have will to continue this meaningless existence. So it’s very complicated conflict that is happening right now in my head.  Sorry for grammar"	sw
"I am really ashamed of my lack of social skills I was diagnosed with mild autism a couple of months ago. I've always been socially awkward throughout my entire life and have had close to no friends, but I never realised the reason for that.  I've never disclosed the fact that I have autism to my college, but a few professors seem to have noticed how socially awkward and blunt am I. A few of them have decided to teach me social skills where they will explicitly tell me I sound too blunt or awkward.  I don't know I can improve my social skills. The thing is I sometimes don't know how people will react so I am constantly scared of accidentally offending people. I also feel inferior to everyone else due to my lack of social skills. My six year old cousin is a social butterfly and even he makes fun of me for being socially awkward.  Tl;dr: I've recently been diagnosed with mild autism.

There I also might fall on top of a car which will cost my parents an even bigger fortune. I could just jump right now and fake it as an accident, but I don't want my parents to pay even more money"" it's very random and is just my head trying to invent new suicide methods to keep my selections open, it's like wtf brain?

"There's no other way out There is something wrong with me and nobody can tell me otherwise. My relationship of 10 months with the love of my life is crumbling, his dad passed two weeks ago and was sick for two months beforehand, and his anxiety is taking over his life. I haven't seen him since the funeral 2 weeks ago and when we do call or text I walk on eggshells because I never know what I might say will set him off. I can't do anything to help him, even just existing makes it worse for him. I am useless. I can't express my suicidal feelings because nothing could compare to what he's going through. He says he isn't sure he can continue our relationship because I've become a trigger point for his anxiety, even just me calling him yesterday to ask if I could stop by to see him and his family on Easter was enough to set him off. I'm a toxic presence without even meaning to be, it's just who I am.   But I am not ready to lose him, I can't go through another breakup that I did not want. I can't be abandoned again. I can't explain to people again that he left. I can't be faced with people's sympathy and empty ""well fuck him, you deserve better!""'s when I know that I don't. I can't dodge reminders of him again and try to suppress happy memories with him, because remembering the good times hurts so bad.  And by ""again"" I mean I've done this before - I've been left before. Again by someone I truly loved and was so happy with, and it came out of nowhere, he blind-sighted me. I still don't know why he left to this day. But obviously it was something irreparably wrong with me. It look a full year for me to feel just OK. At the time, I thought it was the worst thing that could and would ever happen to me. But I was wrong, the worst thing would be to have to re-live it. Because at least with the first go-round, there was hope that something good would present itself to me after the heartbreak I'd endured.  And it did, but now the cycle is happening again. And I have no hope that if he leaves me, I'll be OK. I won't be. Because now I know I am worthless, useless, a burden. I know now that it really is me, not them. Nobody will ever truly love me, maybe I could find love again, but I know it would end just the same way. I can't do this again. I won't. If I lose him, I will end it.  He was the only thing driving my life forward. We had plans, to get married, to buy a house, he was living with me. If that gets pulled out from under me I have nothing to look forward to but the whole thing happening over again with some other poor soul.   I have friends, but two of my closest ones moved away this year for their master's degrees and will likely stay there. They are happy and have their whole lives ahead of them, I do nothing for them but bring them down. I like my job but I don't make enough money to have a very bright future, I only make enough to live. My debt is years if not decades away from being paid off. The only thing I would ever consider staying for is my family, it would devastate them and I love them dearly, but they too will be gone one day, and even now I can't keep burdening them, showing up at their house in tears and having them console me week after week. It would be fairer to them for me to leave.  What a testament it is to my weakness and uselessness that I can't even deal with the thought of this breakup without feeling suicidal; I can't even wait to see if it actually happens. If he stays with me, I don't deserve it. "	sw

"I don't know how to continue living Okay, so be prepared this is gonna be a long one.  3 years ago I moved to a new city to study and realize my professional dreams afterwards with my then girlfriend. After 3 months being there we broke up, because she would'nt love me anymore after four years being together. Therefore the break up wasn't easy for me and I think neither for her (at least she said so). So after a while I met this new girl and felt in love with her. I put a lot of effort in the relationship because I didn't want to lose her and break up again. I did everything for her but in conclusion the relationship was very poisonous for me. She lied to me, betrayed me and in the end cheated on me. At the same time my uncle and my grandfather died because of sickness and one friend took his life because of depression through hanging. As you can immagine I was very devastated and had no friend to talk. I became suicidal too and my then girlfriend could not handle it and left (we were together about 7 months) while I was the first time at the hospital because of my suicidal thoughts. There I began a therpy and slowly began to feel better. I didn't take meds except 1-2 times, but I didn't like it and wanted to get out of this mess by myself.  As time passed I met a new girl. We both fell in love. After small initial problems it became a very good and healthy relationship. I felt better with her than with all other girlfriends before and it just felt right. I was very convinced that this would be what true love would feel like. I did everything for her and treated her like a princess. Two months ago I finished at university and got my degree. Everything was fine but yesterday we had a big argument and in the end she told me she prefered to be single anyways. I asked her if she was serious and she said yes. We broke up. This was an awful shock for me. I have nobody I can talk to. My family is far away. I have my degree but it's very difficult to find a job. I already was rejected a few times. I'm feeling suicidal again. I don't know how to handle my feelings. I feel lonely and I am not able to eat. My self doubts are tremendous. I don't want to go back to the hospital again having to admid that I couldn't manage it. What should I do? Could you help me? Thanks for reading and sorry for my English. It is not my mother tongue. I am living in Europe.  tl;dr: My girlfriend left (again) and a few other bad things that happened in the past led me to being suicidal again.

I’ve worried for so long about what my decision will do to you and I hope you end up having a great life and getting past this. You are the most amazing person I’ve ever known.

Received free gift in the post but So I'm not sure if this is the right place to put this but wasn't sure where it would fit in right.   So a few weeks ago I receive this parcel delivered  to my home. I open it and it's a lovely perfume set but I have zero memory of having done anything for this company. I don't recognise the name of the sender and there's no letters or explanation in it except a kinda bad quality A4 printed page that states the company name (brand new to me) and thanks me for doing a survey.   I  don't do surveys online and I most definitely don't give out my home address.  I've tried googling the company name and I get nothing.  Have no emails from or to them.   Could anyone help me with whay this could be cos I'm kinda freaked out now the more I think about how odd it is. 	cc
"I survived On the 26th of March. I decided to end it all. I was found and just released from the hospital. It's been a bumby ride, but I'm glad I'm still alive and getting the help I need. I was found in my room with my wrist slit and a bottle of pills.  Edit: My Story  On the week of the 26th of March. My wife told me she doesn't want to be with me anymore. We got married this past December. I was heart broken and I wanted to know why. All she told me that she's a horrible person and doesn't want to break my heart.  I don't think she realized that's exactly what she's doing. She hasn't been talking to me and I've been having panic attacks or well really bad anxiety. I tried my best to keep the marriage alive. I wanted to fix things, but she wasn't doing anything. I felt empty, heart broken, and not loved. She's my world and I love her. She then told me that she was selfish of saying yes to my proposal. After a 2 weeks of that going on I couldn't bear with the pain anymore. Sleepness nights and thoughts of suicide. I wanted to hang myself. I didn't want to feel anymore pain. On Saturday March 26 I got home around 12pm in the afternoon after working +24hrs straight. I decided that it was time. I accepted my fate. I new this was real and death is death. I wrote a note for anyone who found me on my bed.  I needed to go to work that same day at 10pm. I took 2 pills of Ambien. 2 then turned to half a bottle of 10mg. I proceeded to grab a kitchen knife and slash my wrist multiple times. As I layed there with tears I was thinking about my wife. I just wanted to hear her voice one last time.  To my surprise she answered and I was crying and told her everything thing is going to be alright, and it wasn't her fault. She alerted the police and as time passes my door is slammed open. The rest is history to my recovery."	sw
"I Highly Doubt It'll Get Much Better I've had semi-frequent suicidal thoughts since my sophomore year of high school, and as a college freshman, I don't see how the whole ""life gets better!!!1111!"" thing works. I'd say that in my life so far, most years are worse than the previous. Elementary school was ok, middle school was the only outlier in that I enjoyed it for some reason, the first half of high school was not great, the second half was bad, and now college is the worst. I am getting terrible grades and feel consistent stress.   I know the freshman year of college is supposed to be the easiest workload-wise, so I'm sure life will get worse when I am pulling more all-nighters than the almost weekly ones I have to pull this year. After college, I'll have to leave my friends yet again to work for a company that doesn't care for me and have adult responsibilities. I'll have to worry about money, way more frequent stressful social interactions, constant monotony, keeping my job. One of my high school teachers confirmed that life doesn't get better when she mentioned that she wishes she could be in our place when my friends and I were complaining.  I also just experienced my first breakup a month ago. I was with him for 3 years. I imagined living my life with him, experienced so many firsts with him. I will probably find someone else, but I will probably fall out of love with them too. They'll cheat on me once I'm no longer attractive; it happens to plenty of people. Love isn't worth living for. The future isn't worth living for. What's the point in staying alive then? The good days have never and will never outweigh the bad ones."	sw

"Don't want to live anymore Hello.  This is my first time talking about this to anyone.    My parents describe me as serious during my infanthood which has persisted with me through the years (age: 18-24).  During my childhood I had brief instances of not belonging with my family.  They were fleeting, but occurred regularly.  One day I told my father when this feeling came on, but he quickly and somewhat harshly quelled me.  In addition to these feelings I found myself never being able to be genuinely happy.  During birthday parties, christmas, etc, I always had to force a smile to please others.  Growing up I had few friends and always found myself leeching off my younger brother for friends causing him to get upset with me on numerous occasions.  I never had a birthday party where I had friends over.  High school and my teen years were more or less the same, but I had a small friend group.  This lack of genuine happiness has constantly been there overshadowing my entire life.  I have never been suicidal before only sad.  Now I am suicidal, and I think about it daily.  If I were to do go through with it I would OD on an opiate.  At this point I am open to ideas and am willing to try almost anything.  Sorry that the writing is sporadic, and the transitions are non-existent.  Feel free to ask me questions so I can further clarify my circumstances.    "	sw
"Today is my birthday and i cried I wrote this originally as about 8 paragraphs but i'm gonna scrap all that now and re-write this.  I turned 16 today and after my mum insulting me a few days back on me being completely alone and having no one to celebrate today with I was so determined to shut out the loneliness of my life and celebrate today with even one person.  Not a single person wanted to do things with me today. Not even meet me for food for an hour. Not even my dad knew it was my birthday today, he didn't even call me. My mum went to work so I spent the day alone and I cried. Last year I had a small party on the rooftop of a carpark, I was having the time of my life. Today after I cleaned my room and had a shower I just sat on my bed and looked at the mirror and I just cried.  It felt like I was looking at another person and I just felt sorry for the boy in the mirror. after the sudden realisation it was me I just cried. I cries at how many suicidal thoughts Ive had this year alone and how fucked up my life has become. I wanted just one person in my life today, And god just didn't send me anything. I got money from my mum today but thats it, she was still arguing with me almost for a week now.  I can't live like this anymore my life from as far as i can remember back, is filled absolutely to the brim with dead ends and disappointments. Im not normal and never will be. Everyone gets to come home to a great family and all that while I dont even want to come home.   I have about 5 years left to live anyways so i might as well kill myself to avoid living a short life of darkness."	sw

"Can someone please tell me whats wrong with me?? I don’t know what happened but I somehow ended up sat outside my old high school, I can't really remember walking there, I originally just walked to this field next to my house because I needed to get out and then I was meant to go home but I think I just carried on walking or something because I ended up on the floor outside the school gates. I stayed sat there for about 30 minutes, 3 cars stopped and asked me if I was okay and stuff. I just didn’t want to move because I was so tired and really confused about how I got there (obviously I walked but I can't really remember it) and why I went there of all places?? I haven’t been there for 2 years and I have really bad memories of that place so seeing it made me feel shit. After a while I got up, I didn’t want to go home so I just walked around for ages, I was in a really low mood and I kept getting these huge urges just to jump in front of the cars that were going by. I don’t know how to explain how I felt but my head felt fuzzy and it was like I wasn’t actually there. I was going to call the crisis team thing because I felt like I was going to do something stupid again but I didn’t want my mom to know. Another hour went by and I started walking home, I crossed this bridge that went over train tracks and I just stared over the fence looking down for ages, I don’t even know if I was going to jump or not because I was so out of it at that point. I managed to get myself home somehow and its been like an hour and I’m more myself now, hence why I’m writing this, I still feel low, but I’ve been trying to distract myself by listening to music and stuff. I don’t want to have to feel like this and to fear what’s going to happen when I’m low, because I don’t know what I’d do, there’s no reasoning with myself when I’m like that. I’m scared, and I need help, but I don’t know how I could get help, I’ve been trying to make it better since I was 13/14 and it just keeps getting worse. "	sw

I'm not exactly in the best position with mental health, I haven't been diagnosed with anything but I tend to feel sad all the time so the fact that quite a few of my friends will be leaving soon isn't exactly helping. Recently, I got a girl. She is cute, kind, pretty and perfect for me but she's leaving. She's the best thing that has happened to me since I got her and is really helping me with my current mental state.

"Weird things you do What's up CC, what are the weird things ya'll do?  I'll start:  I have this weird form of escapism where I constantly picture myself in other people's lives. For example: for the past 2 years I gained an interest in choreograph dance because of a famous dance studio in Korea. They do loads of original choreo videos to tons of popular songs. I saw one on Friday that had a really cute part in it - https://youtu.be/SDAL5VCdKpc?t=20 (sorry, the link might load on 50% speed for some reason - and if it starts at the beginning, jump to the 20s mark). The part where the guy is on his knees and the girl walks around him - the way she looks at him was so cute. I know it's just part of the choreo, but it was like ""I wish I could find someone who looked at me like that"". They both seemed to have so much fun in the choreo, and as I watch more and more of their videos, I start to daydream about myself being a choreographer at that studio and being friends with all of them there. They have a big social media presence and it looks like they all have a blast working there, so I kept imagining myself in all the pictures and videos I've seen and being friends with all of them. Even in the link earlier, I imagined myself being the guy in the video (it's his choreo) and creating other awesome dance choreos.  Whenever this kind of thing happens, I just get almost obsessed with indulging in this mental escapism and then I get really depressed for what could be a few days to a few weeks. I just become disengaged from life and just spend all my time daydreaming. It's really unhealthy I know.  This probably sounded really all over the map haha. Sorry for the wall of text.  So what are weird things you do?"	cc

"Adult Sports Rec Leagues It's spring and I'm kind of interested in playing sports. The thing is, I've never been good at any of them. (incoming PTSD story) I have this experience stuck in my head. I used to go to a rec center a lot and just shoot 3-pointers. Like, just by myself, not playing in a game. Then one day, somebody came up to me and asked me to play in their game because they needed another person for equal teams. I didn't want to and I told them I'm just shooting around, but they insisted begging like ""Come onnnnn, you'd really be helping us out."" So, I agreed.    Then the game happened and...I couldn't guard, so the other team kept having the player I was guarding run past me to the hoop and score at will. My team lost handily. I went to the locker room, feeling totally embarrassed by how dumb I looked. Then, I hear a voice enter the room ""That guy was AWFUL!"" I look over and it's the guy that begged me to play. He sees me and says ""Hey good game, man.""   I hated this experience so much that I don't want to play basketball ever again. Shootaround tournament? Sure, those are fun. Not sure if they have leagues for that, though. But maybe I could join a baseball/softball/volleyball or some other sports kind of league.    So, I was wondering if anyone had experience in playing sports in a pay-to-play kind of league (as far as I've seen, everybody has to pay to play). I'm not well-versed in athletic endeavors, but I really think I need to increase my amount of daily exercise because right now I don't have any. So, in regards to sports leagues...   What were your experiences?    How competitive/talented were the other players?    Did they get really mad at the really untalented players/teammates?   Have you made friends by participating?  "	cc

I'm 24, female, never had a *real* job, don't have my license, have never had an actual relationship, don't have a single friend outside of family, live at home with my emotionally abusive mother and younger brother, am disgustingly unattractive and over-weight, have no interest in the things I used to hold dear, I lock myself in my room all day only leaving to eat or use the restroom. I'm not working. I'm not studying. I'm not living. All of this because of my crippling anxiety and depression. I'm too scared to work, I'm too scared to get my license even though I *can* drive, I'm too scared to form meaningful relationships with anyone; irl or otherwise, I'm too scared to stick up for myself in the face of my family, I don't see the point in forcing myself to workout or pushing myself to partake in the hobbies I used to enjoy, there's no reason for me to leave my room as there's nothing for me outside these four walls.  I'm too afraid to live, and that's why I think I'm going to kill myself soon. These issues have plague me for years, even before I graduated high school, but they've gotten progressively worse these past few weeks. All I can think about is killing myself. Everyday, from the moment I wake up, to the moment I go to sleep, I fantasize about taking my own life. Overdosing on my anti-depressants and Benadryl then topping it off with a bag over my head. Slicing my forearms and climbing into a hot bath. Laying my head on the train tracks. Every. Day.   My years of therapy haven't helped. My years of medication haven't helped. My stent in a crisis center hasn't helped.   I don't see any other option. "	sw

"My Mother is stressing me out beyond reason Im studying at a university abroad And I have failed or got a really bad grade my first semester subjects due to starting a month late and searching for accommodation for atleast 2 weeks or I would have stayed on the streets. I have been doing my absolute best to pass but the subject were very difficult on my own....I have tried studying and watching old lectures and everything but the syllabus was too long in several cases ( mathematics was much more difficult and longer than abitur according to our professor) and exams were just too hard for me in my situation so I failed. The thing is she linked this with studying with my friends which I only recently started doing it because they were very helpful and my progress increased significantly. She now commands me to just cut all relations with any friends that I have made whom for the first time in my life are ones who i looked forward to seeing them the next day because I enjoy there company. On top of that she demands excellent grades in future not knowing how hard it is or how hard I have worked. I dont know how to deal with her anymore she just shouts or demands things I cannot fullfill atleast as of now which gets me so much stress, fear and tears. How to deal with that? Please note that I by no means hate her but appreciate how hard she works and sacrifices for me but I just still cant just accept this. Also I have got in high school pretty competitive grades that allowed to be offered places at different universties"	sw
"I can't do it anymore. I was a crackhead over 12 years. I fucked my entire middle age up (started late 20's got clean in mid 40's). I was born with a birth defect (PE) that I had to have corrected to live. My parents would have done NOTHING if it weren't for my life on the line.   I ran around on my own since age 14. I met men just by talking to calls with the wrong number. I came and went as I pleased. Until my cop dad moved us to a different city because he thought he'd be appointed Chief. He was not.   He rolled up on me all the time out of protecting his rep, which ruined mine.   I had SO much potential. I had SO much love inside me. HAD.   There's nothing for me anymore. I've traveled a bit, and done every drug imaginable, and had my fist up a man's ass. I have LITERALLY done just about everything other than harm another person or animal or child willingly.   My dad died. I found out he shot himself in the head this last Christmas.    I just want to not exist anymore. No throwaway, check my history, I hate this world and what it's become in the name of tolerance and diversity. I USED to be a coveted employee, now I am barely getting calls on my resume. I USED to like running around my city at all hours and having fun, now bars are empty because of smoking regulations and I get stressed just walking around due to arrogant blacks who turn left and try to run me over, who overtake our property with no compunction, who bitch me out when I don't give them money.   I am fucking DONE.   My dad had the right idea. I cut, but when I go at least I will go into some ghetto alley and make someone else clean my shit up other than those who I care about. Let the nigs hoot and holler over another dead white woman. No one will care.     I suck. The world sucks. You, however, dear reader are an awesome person. Thanks for listening to an old racist bitch. Edit: if anyone wants to talk please comment! I need to feel helpful."	sw

It's the first time all year anybody has called or invited me anywhere just to say hi or from keeping me in mind. It's very comforting, I thought I had been completely lost.

"Asshole Dad Makes Me Want To Hang Myself Asshole Dad is back at it again. Out of nowhere, my Dad checks the garage has a meltdown out of how ""dirty,"" it is and screams my sister.

People in the group chat were like ""I'm so writing a long review about this prof..."" and I thought it would be funny to write a rough draft pretty much saying ""This teacher is completely useless, get rid of him."" And I stupidly posted it in the group chat just to get some laughs.

I like to sit in my room and doodle around on the acoustic, but I find myself pretty much playing all the same chords. And I can’t seem to craft a decent melody once I do have a guitar part I like. Even if I can, I can never seem to write any decent lyrics that flow well with the melody and guitar.   Anybody here ever write music? Anyone good at it? Any pointers would be awesome.

"On the verge of ending it all Today has been exceptionally hard for me. I was doing spring cleaning around the house when my dad started yelling and raising his fists at me for not doing things quickly enough. I locked myself in my room and barricaded the door. He yelled at me ""I'm gonna kick the door in!"" and I heard him say to my mom ""One day I'm gonna murder that girl!"". It was all too much so I let the mood die down they called me out for dinner so I came out. They expected me to apologize for locking my door and said it's my fault for being scared and always wanting to kill myself. I couldn't take it anymore I grabbed my fork and started stabbing myself. After that, I ran right back into my room and barricaded the door. For the past 2 years, I've been managing my depression and anxiety. I've been in college full time, been living with my parents, and I have a loving boyfriend. I've been having panic attacks from nothing and when I drive home my brain puts thoughts of cutting myself and letting myself bleed out onto the pages of my coloring books. These thoughts are so vivid I can feel my wrists burn in pain. I've never cut myself before but I do keep a kitchen knife in my bedroom. I've been saying goodbye more and more. I just don't want to be causing anyone including myself any more pain. I think I could die peacefully knowing that the only pain left to cause is the pain of losing me. I feel guilty and ashamed I haven't done anything with my life. I called the helpline and my counselor. I'm not on any medications. I'm just so tired and helpless I don't want to do anything with my life except throw it away. I'm tired of being told to look on the bright side and to practice self-compassion and self-awareness. I don't think anyone can help me but I'm too scared to die. Maybe I wanna have someone push me outta a window. I don't really know what I want. All I know is can someone tell me the easiest way to kill myself besides cutting cause I can't do it."	sw
"Im just waiting for death. My last words if things go my way. As I write this I am waiting for death. I took enough pills that will definitely fuck me up but hopefully kill me, and am cutting myself until I bleed out as a precautionary measure.   I can’t be happy. I don’t know how. The meds. The therapy. It doesn’t work. It’s not enough. 24 years of suffering. Years of therapy and meds and treatment. It’s all for naught.   I want to leave him but I’m so selfish for leaving him. He has no one. Im a horrible human for wanting to leave someone who has no one.   I want to meet my unborn child in heaven. I want to play with the child I should be 9 months pregnant with if he or she was not taken from me. I want to hold him. I want to feel him in my stomach. I want to feel him kick. I want to complain of being tired and swollen and wanting to get this baby out of me. I want to hold my child in my arms. I want to introduce him to my family.   I want to be with my father. I want him to yell at me and tell me to make good choices. I want to see him healthy and breathing. I want to hug him and roll my eyes when he annoys me. I want to laugh at his terrible singing and stupid jokes. I will take the bad with the good. The screaming the fighting the “fuck you”s. I just need my father.   I want to be with my friends who died. I want to explain to a that I’m sorry for not staying in touch. I’m sorry for not making up with her. I’m sorry for being so close to her boyfriend. I should have kept away knowing that it might be misinterpreted. I want to tell her how her mom wailed at her funeral. What an impact that had on me. How everyone turned up. How we all cried.   Im ready. God be willing, I will pass shortly. I will meet my maker and accept whatever comes. I accept responsibility. Mea culpa. Mea maxima culpa. I am sorry. "	sw
Here we go again Ok so I’ve been depressed for so long. My depression came back after only like 4 months at uni and it all went downhill. My gender issues cropped up again - questioning if I was transgender. It’s hard enough dealing with depression while at uni - let alone thinking you might be trans and having to transition. Anyway I jumped off a bridge 11 March and have been in hospital ever since. I’m still so depressed and now I’m extra depressed about my injuries. I’m still able to walk and hopefully my bladder and bowels will get back to normal. It’s horrible - I feel so trapped. I feel like there’s nothing to leave hospital for and I dread being in the outside world so much. I actually can’t stand being seen and it’s been a constant problem for me. Now every time I wake up I’m reminded of my attempt and also the uncertainty of whether my bowels and bladder will get back to normal is eating away at me. Im so depressed I feel like damaging my chances of physical recovery. My time in this hospital is nearly over. I have nothing to recover for. Everything is so painful. I was sure I would die and wouldn’t survive and so I neglected everything. Everything is getting to me now - trienfships I’ve neglected - the fact I cant go back to uni this year. I didn’t even want to. The urge to die is overwhelming. Loneliness is killing me. Even though I have people that could maybe visit I can’t face them. I honestly either want to die or just nap all day and not face my issues. I’m so so tempted to end it. I can’t keep on like this. Me surviving has changed nothing about my outlook and I’m just as pessimistic as ever. I still feel like my situation is terrible. And now I have the added stress of physical recovery. I’m so alone. I have no motivation and I can’t keep pretending I can stay in hospital forever but I feel it’s either kill my self in here or as soon as I’m out. All I can think about is ending my life and now things are getting so bad I feel like I need to. I miss my friends but I can’t reach out to them because I wanna die. Every day I wake up and just count down the hours until I can kill myself. I don’t want to ever be in the outside world again or basically start anything again. I’ve given up hope but I stay here and idk why  	sw
"I feel so stuck. I can't really believe im writing this right now, but here i am, and i feel like im moreso just trying to lay it all out in words for myself, because my mind is so messed up and confused and i really dont know how to feel and/or what to do  im 17, and my a levels are going to shit. i havent even done my coursework thats overdue for 3 months. My teachers have given me so much extra time its crazy, now its due in a week and i still havent even fucking done the shit but at the same time i cant be arsed, i cant deal with it, its just too much but at the same time i have nowhere else to go  sometimes i have to ground myself because i feel so out of it sometimes, like i need to stroke a rough piece of metal or wood because it brings me back to earth and makes it all feel real again. Sometimes i take a look at my surroundings too closely and the 3D image of life overwhelms me. Its so surreal that i need to close my eyes and just listen to my own breathing to calm me down.  (I just want you to know that im not mental. This is only occasionally, i dont constantly feel like this, but moments like this do put me into existential issues and really make me feel strange.)  Moments like this cause numbness and the numbness leads to shit, like right now i have a strong desire for someone to beat me up so bad theres blood or for me to harm myself, i dont mean to be explicit but the sight of blood from myself is something i crave because it makes me feel human.  Im writing this slightly intoxicated because i know sober me would cringe at me writing about this. but now i just cant hold it in. i cant tell anyone i know so im just spilling it here. to be honest i need to hurry before i sober up.  sometimes i take moments where i just listen to music and think about things in too much depth, i think about how much i want to die but im scared of what happens after death. I am not religious, but i feel like there is not nothing, and i am terrified of whatever is to come. and even the thought of nothingness is not comforting to me. The idea of my ""soul"" or mental character just disappearing forever is something that is so horrifying to me for it is all i am. The idea of my mere presence not existing anymore is such a foreign concept for it is all i know. I know myself over anyone and everything, not that i think i am superior but i am the only one ever to know my thoughts  Anyway this is nonsense, i cant write anymore despite me having so much more to say. I just needed to write some jibberish thoughts. For anyone who reads this, please tell me what to do Thanks  "	sw

"Job searching feels like a dangerous gamble right now. I have a decent stable job, but I found something much better in every aspect. It’s a job where I need multiple background checks, physicals, and a mental evaluation. I was given a start date (April 23rd) and was originally told that I could put in my two week notice once I finish my physical and mental evaluation yesterday. After my physical I was told I’d have to wait another day for my blood work to be processed. So, I waited to hear from them today. I decided to put in my 2 week notice in tomorrow (April 5th), but then I was told that the job still isn’t 100% until 2 background checks were complete and that it should take about another week. I don’t of any reason I’d have an issue with the background check, but I don’t want to put in my notice until it’s a 100% sure thing. If I put in my notice a little later I might not have a full 2 weeks of notice which would burn the bridge of possibly getting my job back right away or later down the line. I can’t decide if I should just go with it and put the notice in, or hold off until the very last minute. "	cc

"How to help your SO through mental illness I’m sorry if this isn’t the right place for this post, but I don’t know where else to go.  My SO suffers from depression and anxiety. We’ve been best friends for 10 years before we dated and he has never really expressed to me when he’s feeling which things, so I don’t expect him to start doing it now. He’s more open about his anxiety since we started dating, but I have no idea how he feels about the other stuff.  He’s been suicidal for quite a few years and I have no idea how he feels now. He says he would never leave me like that, but I know it’s much more complicated than that and therefore do not find that believable or comforting in the slightest.  The fear and worry has pretty much consumed my life. I don’t know how to help him, how to believe him, how to support him, or how to know he’s okay. I feel helpless. I feel useless.  I’ve considered calling the suicide hotline just to get some insight of what to do when you’re the person on the other side of the situation.  Does anyone else feel this way with their SO? Does anyone have any advice of what I can do to be the best GF to him I can be? I’m at a loss."	sw

"I seem to have really fallen in love with cooking. I guess I needed a new hobby, and I found one. I keep getting more and more into it over the past few months. I always did the cooking at my house, but I can't stop trying new things and meals from scratch. Yesterday I basically prepped and cooked for 2 hours. I live alone now, and to some it might seem insane to do all that just to sit and eat alone. I don't know what else to do with all the free time I have at home these days though. A lot of the other things I used to do lost their appeal. It is cool though, because while it is gone once you eat it, there is this feeling of pride and accomplishment there.   https://imgur.com/a/dNcNd That was last night. Homemade ricotta gnocchi ""mac"" & cheese with a many cheese blend sauce. Boiling potatoes, peeling, mixing the dough, it all takes a good amount of time, but it really beats the store bough gnocchi. So much lighter. You can see the gnocchi on its own if you scroll down.  I don't know that I should be *promoting* myself on here, but if anyone wants, I keep posting the stuff I make to my IG account if anyone is interested."	cc
Today is my last day at my current workplace and it feels like a series finale. This is the first time I'm leaving a job and I'm leaving on relatively good terms. Made a few friends here but it won't be the same because I won't see them on a daily basis.	cc
"Does anyone else overthink situations like crazy then when it comes to it, it turns out to be nothing? I have really bad anxiety. I will overthink situations and think of everyone possible worst solution then when it comes to it it turns out to be nothing to even worry about.   For example, at work if a coworker didn't say hi to me or something I'd immediately think I didn't something wrong to upset then and worry about that the whole shift. It's really annoying and something that's hard to shake. It makes me a nervous wreck and something I struggle with.   Anyone have the same problem? "	cc

"The GSP at SDSU For those that don't go to SDSU, the GSP is a standardized test for all majors in the school of Journalism. You need an 80% to pass and only get 3 tries before you have to appeal to get into the major or change majors. It has 100 questions related to grammar, spelling, and punctuation.  I haven't studied grammar since elementary school and this test is stressing me the hell out. I'm having a hard time studying for it because of the lack of resources regarding the actual test. And every time I look at various grammar/punctuation rules, I feel like I don't absorb it or understand it completely. But, it might just be dear and stress that's making it more difficult for me.  If there's anyone out there that has taken it or is really good at English grammar/punctuation, how did you study? Any resources you'd like to share? I'm desperate at this point.   (I also think it's silly to require such a difficult test [only an 80% passing rate on the first try] in order to get into a major. Aren't we entering the major in order to learn and master these things??) "	cc

But everyday I have that feeling that will I ever make it? I'm doing my engineering, my grades aren't good. They're low, I cannot depend my future on college, and production is a reason of my less grade. That's why there a constant worry in my mind, have I ruined everything? Will I ever make it?

"College Social Life Hey everybody,  I'm sure reddit has seen many of these posts, but I'm lacking a social life in college. I'm currently a second year at a UC.  I think part of it is that I opted out of living in dorm last year and lived in the on-campus apartments. I did plenty of research last year for some suggestions. I joined multiple clubs, even became board of a social club but it is inactive and no effort is put in by any of the other members and I don't have the time to do all the work for the club. I meet a lot of people in my classes but it doesn't go beyond the classroom. I rushed a fraternity during my first year and after the first two days I really did not feel like it was right for me. If I continued I would be completely faking my personality. Other than that, I'm pretty studious, I intern 8-10 hours a week but I still have a lot of free time.  Does anyone have any suggestions? I'm not incredibly desperate or sad about my social life, I just feel like it would be nice to have some people to hang out with. I realize that college really does only happen once and I don't want to look back and only remember the grades I received and the exams I took."	cc

"Who is your most obnoxious friend? Let’s call him Dan.  Dan cracks me up because he seems to have no social awareness. He’ll act like an idiot in public without caring what people think about him. It can be annoying because of secondhand embarrassment, but it’s also admirable.   He does this stupid “thrust” thing like if he’s having sex. only when he thrusts his hips in, he jumps forward. And he does this repeatedly, thrust-jumping off into the distance. My friends and I dare him to see how long he can thrust jump. He’ll basically thrust jump the length of a football field in a mall if we bet him that he’s not able to. He’s really immature for our age (22)  I remember in our high school drama class, we had a new kid introducing himself. The teacher said “Thank you Ryan. Welcome, you’ve just made a class full of friends”.  And then Dan yelled from the back “AND EVERYONE OF THEM IS FAKE!” (which was true). Suddenly everyone turns around and glares at us. He’s always saying things that people normally wouldn’t say, and he does it with no shame. EDIT: Another time he got mad because he heard a rumor that Zac Efron would be playing Daredevil on Netflix. He got so angry he kicked over a metal trash can and stomped all over it during lunch, storming away and leaving us and the whole quad in shock.   Do you have an obnoxious friend? Or are you the obnoxious one in the group?"	cc

"I'm feeling really good about my thirties I'm not really sure what it's all about, and since I have always been a pretty pessimistic/negative person I feel as though this can't really last or something bad is going to happen because I just feel excited about my thirties.          Got married in my early 20s, still going strong, have a little one, and it has all been difficult but worth it. My 20s were full of hand-wringing and worrying about what to do, where to be, and even what to believe...  Now, I realise that I have a better grasp on things..    and things are not as dire as I felt they were as a teenager and 20s-er.          I'm feeling hopeful that my thirties are going to be a new journey of self discovery, without as much anxiety and hand wringing, and exploring. While I can't just pick up and travel across Europe because I have responsibilities, I can do and be a lot of other things that I couldn't in my 20s.          Anyway, when I was a kid I thought 30 was so old but I feel as young as ever. I've also started exercising, eating better, working on hobbies.       Anybody else feel that way?

"Pathetic I’m a 17 y/o Korean boy, I feel pathetic, unwanted and I’m on the verge of suicide. It’s an on and off thought that won’t go away. I do have friends, and I feel happy for a moment, but then it all goes away. I go to church, and there is a youth group that I am forced to join, and I’ve known the people for years. But they blatantly make plans to do things that day, and while I’m there, and don’t invite me anymore. They used to, maybe out of pity, but it adds to the unwantedness I feel. If I get hurt by my parents, I let my feelings lose to them. But they always tell me to just let it go and forget about it. Side note:  I’m not without my flaws, and I said that I don’t like to interact with people because their all fake. My dad calls me a wuss, which is true. He points out all my flaws and says your not much better than the others. I’m sorry this is all jumbled up, and full of random comments. My emotions are going crazy. Main point is i just feel sad all the time and I don’t know why. It seems my parents don’t understand me, or I’m just not going the right way of solving my issues. "	sw

The only time I leave my house is when I go with my mom to the store.  I have no job because I'm unable to get one due to my really bad anxiety. I babysit for my sister almost every day of the week and that's how I get money even though im seriously underpaid. Her children and mini Satans and I can't stand watching them anymore. It makes me so sad and angry and irritable whenever I have to watch them and i can't wait until they leave. Having to watch them is making me start to resent them and I don't want to not like them but i can t help it anymore.   I have absolutely no friends. The only person I interact with besides my nephew/niece and  son is my mom and she's hardly ever home anymore. I'm left home alone most of the day when I don't babysit. I feel like I'm trapped all the time and I can't take it anymore. I'm so fucking lonely and I can't really do anything about it.  I keep thinking I'm over my ex and then I have random days where I cry a lot because of him. He basically has nothing to do with our kid so I'm raising him on my own which gets to be too much at times when I just want ten minutes to myself and can t have that. I love my son and love being with him but it would be great to have like an hour to myself for once. My ex has a new girlfriend now and that depresses me at times and I can't help but think of what he's probably doing at the moment and that it could be me instead of her with him  My thoughts are a mess all the time and are all over the place. I feel like I'm losing my mind and every day it gets worse.   The loneliness and being trapped in my house and watching my sister's kids are all getting to be way too much for me and it's killing me. I don't know what to do.  If I didn't have my kid, I'd probably have tried to kill myself by now to be honest.   I'm only 20 so I'm hoping that things will get better and won't always be depressing like they are now but I honestly don't think anything will ever get better   I'm so fucked up from my kid's dad because he always beat the shit out of me and mentally abused me so bad and cheating on me and so many other horrible things and I can't get past that either      I don't think there's any hope for me anymore."	sw

"Trying to get better, but can't. I must not be trying hard enough. Or maybe I'm not trying at all. I've been seeking treatment for a real long time, and I feel like very little has improved. Medicines don't even help me. I'm such a parasite to family and friends. I tried to seize opportunities and options, like going back to school, volunteer, so on, but it's just all overwhelming to me. I've been so depressed with suicidal thoughts that I barely leave my room these days. I can't talk to my family about my problems, because they'll just say it's cowardice, I'm selfish and seeking attention. I was told by them one time that no one likes a depressed person. Also, I've been avoiding them, to avoid any further injury and such.  Life has never been kind to me. I've faced failure and disappointment so much that I'm too scared to even try, because I'm afraid everything will just hurt me again. Everything about my mental illness and what caused my mental illness convinced me that I'm the ultimate failure, and everything about that just makes me feel worse and worse.

I'm going to commit suicide tommorow. There's nothing stopping me. If you call the cops I will just go when I get out of the psyche ward.  The reason why I'm commiting suicide really isn't selfish or anything. I'm just in a lot of pain. I was hit by a car 7 yrs ago and havent been the same since. My head always hurts. Like a lot. Its so bad theres no relief in sight. I really don't know what has prevented me from commiting suicide till now. I wanted to before but was too scared. But now I have nothing to lose no family no friends no opportunity to ger better. I've tried it all and meds only make things worse. The times I'm not in pain my head just feels empty. Its unbearable and AlI cant function. I just lay around all day like a vegetable pushing through the pain. I sometimes have bad panic attacks or bad pain throughout the body I think its a type of fibromyalgia. I cant even watcha movie in piece. I always feel rushed and even this message I don't even know what ai wrote I just have a short attention span. I most likely have some sort of brain damage. If its any comfort I'm dying from hep c ina year anyways so I'm saving me the pain. I'm just writing it here because I know my parents will send me to a psyche ward where ill be put on meds that make the pain worse. If you do call the cops ill definately do it. Ill probably be a pusyy and sis out since i fear the pills will just add to the damage and inwont die. Like I don't even want to die. I love life and being with people and my parents and friends.what I can't support is the constant pain and the leech to society I've become. There's no hope for me. Like seriously I've tried it all.

"How do you deal with extreme emotions? If you experience them at all. I'm talking anger, depression... whatever. Mostly negative emotions I guess, because those are the ones which require management right?  Personally I've been hitting the gym. I started realizing it might even help fuel my workouts when I went while really angry one day. I ran for like 40 minutes straight which was really surprising to me since I don't usually have that much stamina. It didn't feel like a long time either because of the adrenaline.  I've been trying to cope by going to the gym ever since. The only con is sometimes people look at me weird because I look a little *too* determined (when I'm angry) or a little *too* lost in my own thoughts (when I'm sad). Oh and some days I feel like crying at the gym, but I just try to focus on my workout.  I'd like to find a more... peaceful? way to cope if possible. Or at least something I can do at any time at home. I do yoga but it doesn't make my body feel exhausted so my mind still wanders. I used to really enjoy going to the gym, but these days I automatically feel bad because I associate it with these emotions and I don't really want that.

"I can't sleep because of something trivial :/ So, I went to a birthday party today and me being my usual awkward, standoffish self, I was standing a little away from a group of my classmates, with one of my friends.   It turns out they were taking pics and they asked my friend to take a pic for them and in ended up asking her to join in the pic. Hence, they had to call me for the pic as well.   We were a bit hesitant and one of them was like ""Do you need an invitation?"" and ngl it kinda stung. We ended up joining in and I kinda forgot about it until now.   I'm trying to sleep for the past hour and I simply can't! It keeps replaying in my bloody mind.   My doubt is this : How am I ever gonna have a social life in college next year when I end up being chastised for hesitation in taking a pic.   Rant over.  Thanks if ya read this far :)  EDIT: Thank you for all your kind comments! I actually slept and now I feel much better :)"	cc
"i cannot do this anymore i'm so isolated watching people just go about their day interacting with people is like watching some kind of higher evolved species. i'm so jealous of other people and i hate myself beyond the way which words can convey. i'm so fucking ugly i can't look in the mirror without getting emotional and i just wish i had something, better looks, money, social skills, so people would like me. all i've ever wanted was to be popular. to be the kind of person who could post on social media and get tons of likes and have people just message me out of the blue to see how i'm doing or if i want to do anything and that is something i have NEVER had and never will. i'm a virgin fucking loser who's never had a real girlfriend and barely any real friends, i was pulled out of school at a young age and was like home educated so i was basically alone just doing my own thing. i just want to be *loved* by other people and it's all i've ever wanted and i don't think i'm asking for much but the truth is i don't deserve it. i'm not getting into this incel mentality. the world doesn't owe me shit, not even my next breath. so as far as i'm concerned i should just fuck off and die and leave a fancy tip in my pocket for whatever unfortunate person has to deal with my dead body after i'm gone. people wouldn't even FAKE miss me. i've heard in the news about local people dying and people who i know would've never known them personally acted all sad and shit like they knew them and hey if that's how they felt but something just tells me they're just going along with the fucking crowd.  i cannot, and i WILL NOT go on living like this. and i know it'll never happen. people whose faces probably look like rotting avocados are not exactly social media darlings, most of the time anyways. so i don't think i'll do well there, and they probably don't get invited to that many parties either. i guess i don't know what i'm asking suicidewatch. but it seems like the further and further i go down this fucking hole the more i just wanna fucking jump off a cliff because that's exactly what's fitting."	sw

It wasn't even that bad until I got out of school.  Since dropping out, I've been incredibly lonely. I have nothing exciting or of substance in my life anymore.

"Internet friends, Advice Needes Update at bottom   I'm depressed, occasionally suicidal and definitely not in a fully healthy mental place. But I'm not the topic of conversation right now.   I've got a few online friends, whom I talk to and share and help work through issues constantly. We're as close as any irl friends I have. One of these friends is in a very bad mental state. Bulimic, self harming, anxious and absolutely horrified she's gonna be institutionalized because of it. I've helped her work through her rough spots before but...  It's been a day or two since the group's heard from her. There have been periods where she's gone offline before but I don't think this is like the other times. I'm worried, I'm panicky and... I don't know what to do.   Do I wait a bit longer? Do I spam her or keep asking? I just... im worried.   Update: She had a hospitalization scare and was a little preoccupied to come online. She's ok now though, and I couldn't be more relieved. "	sw

"Thank you kind lady for the compliment Yesterday I got some groceries and was heading out. I was about to pass an older lady sitting on a bench when she took a second look at me, clapped her hands together and said ""such beautiful tall girl!"" She started telling me how she admires tall people and always tries to stand straight so she'll be as tall as possible. This sweet tiny lady seemed genuinely impressed when she heard I'm almost two inches taller than her late husband. After come chitchat I again thanked her for the compliment and left. Walking home I thought I want to be just like her when I'm old. I imagined myself being retired, sitting on a bench somewhere and being all grandma like to people walking by. I would wear all pink because that's my favorite color. Maybe I would be known as the odd granny who always wears all pink outfits, maybe I would get a nickname. But after thinking about it more I figured I should try be more like her right now. Some time ago I really wanted to tell a cashier who works the store nearest to my home (so I see her a lot) that her new haircut suits her beautifully but chickened out. Going to try start giving compliments more!  Have you received a compliment lately? What was the best compliment you ever received? Or have you been the one giving a compliment to someone? "	cc

"Anyone else find that their earphones/headphones have become a permanent part of them? I realised this while I was working on an assignment on my laptop. I'd had my earphones in my ears for the last hour, but hadn't listened to any music. They were just...there.   I often have them on at school as well, because standing around awkwardly or sitting in silence staring at the wall is frowned upon. I find it hard having conversations with others, so instead of looking like a weird lonely person who just stares into the distance looking at nothing, I put in my earphones and listen to music. Sometimes I don't even play music, but I'll keep them in.   I have my earphones in right now, but nothing is playing, because I'm busy with an assignment, but I still do not want to take my earphones off.  Listening to music is also one of the only times during the day when I really feel positive emotions. There's not much to be happy about in my life  (or I find it hard being happy) so music provides me with a rush of all these amazing emotions. It feeds me soul lol.  I don't know. I guess music is my only friend :)"	cc

If any of you have seen my comments in the past year, you'll know I don't have a good track record with them. And, to signify my inner meltdown I've had nonstop for the last year, my last cold root beer exploded and made a huge mess.   Except here is the good news. All this time I thought I didn't hold the cards. That everyone else in this life, and death, had more control over me then I did. I was wrong. I'm not doing good right now. I'm not going to lie. But, do you want to know the good part? I have a dream that is perfect for me. A cause I want to fight. A friends wedding to see. And, a world of opportunity. *I also have Smash Bros.* All of that is in the near future and it will be there when I'm ready. Because unlike my root beer I am not having a complete meltdown. I am not falling to the floor in tears and screams anymore.   I hold a lot more power then I once thought I did. I think I proved that by now. Since coming to Reddit I was threatened on my life (by someone on Reddit), had a friendship turn toxic, faced starvation, lost people, etc. I had possibly the worst year of my life, and I'm still here.

"So I have been using RES to filter unwanted subreddits from /r/all... and even after filtering over 500 subreddits, I still see posts that (to me) are time-wasters or don't spark much critical thinking.  After years of browsing through shitposts and cute pet pics (mind you, they are therapeutic, but they are still time-wasters), I decided it was time to try to tailor Reddit into a feed of useful stuff. Now that I have filtered as many shitpost-reddits as I could, I often see posts from subreddits like ""/r/[insert hot female celebrity here]"". Okay. I understand that Reddit's demographic is primarily straight and male. I just wish there was an easier way to filter all the subreddits that I don't want to see.

It’s crazy, I never realized how bad I smelled, how much people would wait for me to smoke before we did anything, or how often I was sick or moody until I gave it up and saw life through the lens of a non smoker again.

"I've never really opened up about this before and I feel like I need to tell someone. I'm 19, female, and an engineering student. I've been depressed and contemplated suicide for years but I never really talked about it to anyone, I was always afraid of what others would think of me if I did and even if they were supportive of me I didn't want to burden them by putting my problems on their plate. I just need a place to vent out without feeling guilty about it.  Back in high school, I was extremely anxious about the future because I never really felt prepared for the real world and doing things on my own despite the fact that I mostly kept to myself. Since starting uni back in September everything has just really spiraled down. I wasn't doing well enough in class and I was stressed to no end. Cue finals week: I didn't pass two of my classes, my childhood role model committed suicide, and my boyfriend of 3 1/2 years broke up with me saying that I was too distant. I felt like I was kicked to the ground and I've been barely crawling through life since.  I've lost any motivation to go out and I've lost passion for my major. I'm almost positive I'm going to get kicked out of uni. I haven't been keeping up with my friends and family, and even the people I still talk to don't know any of this. I blatantly lie to them and I hate myself for doing it but at the same time, I feel like they'll just abandon me if they see how pathetic I am. I especially can't face my parents. Back in seventh grade, one of my best friends attempted suicide and my mother's immediate response was to tell me I shouldn't talk to people like her. I'm afraid of being shut out of my own family for how I feel and because I feel like I've let them down.  People get along fine without me being around. I've never had much to add to the conversation in the first place. Even now that my boyfriend and I are back together he tells me about what he's gotten accomplished in the three months we were separated and I even though he tells me that he missed me I can only think about how he was more productive and how he managed just fine if not better without me.  I feel ashamed and selfish. I don't have a real reason to be depressed. I'm not poor. I have an otherwise supportive family and my partner. I made it into a great university. So why do I feel like this? Why can I literally not imagine any future for myself? I feel like I'm worthless and I don't deserve what's been given to me in life.  The only things that has truly kept me from killing myself are my younger siblings (9, 7, & 4). They mean the world to me and the excited looks on their faces when I visit home make me feel guilty for wanting to leave and never come back. They look up to me, how could I ever want to leave them? But at the same time, it feels like it's only gotten worse and worse. Ending it feels like the most realistic option for me. I don't know what to do."	sw

"I'm messed up. For as long as I can remember I have lashed out at people who probably care about me (excluding family, my family doesn't know) out of fear of being someone that is disposable in their lives. In other words, I give people a reason to leave so that I'm not surprised when they do. I regret every word I say but they just keep coming.  As a first year student in university I made a large group of friends and had a particularly close relationship with one of those friends - we spent countless nights getting to know each other and so many personal details about each other, and we were basically inseparable. This person has since become the fourth person in as many years who decided that they were bored of me after I became emotionally dependent upon them. Since this happened, I have spent the last couple of months of my first year at university personally attacking all of my friends that I made here. Now I know everyone is sick of me and no matter how badly I want to apologize, every time I think to do so a fear so strong grips me and I can't help but to lash out again anyways. What is wrong with me? I care so deeply about all of these people and yet I continue to drive them away. Why do I do this to myself? I hate who I am. I hate having to live with myself. I thought I had gotten over my depression and had recovered completely from my first suicide attempt several years ago, but I'm back to regretting every morning that I wake up, every night that I survive instead of passing away in my sleep. I don't want to deal with me anymore, I haven't wanted to in years but the fact that not even going to school in a different country has changed how horrible I am convinces me that I don't deserve to be here anymore.

Once the police arrived and shined a flashlight on him, they saw the cut on his wrist that I had missed. They involuntarily admitted him to the hospital.  They're holding him for 72 hours, and then I don't know what happens. I don't know if he'll hate me or what. He doesn't have any family, and the hospital won't tell me what's going on. When they took him, they left his phone, wallet and keys at home so even when he gets released I don't know how he'll get home.

I am thinking of offing myself while I am here. I'm over 40 years old and figure I've lived a good first half. I've got a nice stout extension cord from this laptop, a plastic bag from a trash can, some surgical tape, and a several painkillers I've been stockpiling. I'm planning on writing Do Not Resuscitate on my forehead, chest and arm. I have my own hospital room with its own bathroom. The nurses seem to let me sleep uninterrupted from 1-4 am. They do come in to take blood pressure readings and ICP - to relieve my bladder.  I was thinking of wheeling to the bathroom, locking the door, leaving the DNR notes with the sharpie, taking the pills, placing the bag over my head, secure the bag with surgical tape, and then using the laptop cord as a noose and hang myself from the shower head.  My fear is that a nurse or ordely will enter my room and find that I have locked myself in the bathroom and they will find my dying body and attempt to intervene. I don't want to survive with brain damage. will my do not resecuitate request be honored?  Are my fears valid. I don't want this to be unsuccessful . Any advice reddit?  "	sw
"Let's talk music So I usually get addicted to music/artists in phases. Lately I've been lovin' me some rap, especially JCole and G-Easy. I feel like both of them rap about concepts relatable to a lot of people and can be pretty deep, especially JCole. I've spent the afternoon listening to his radio on Spotify, and his song ""For your eyez only"" is a heavy hitter, almost brought me to tears. What music have you guys been listening to today?"	cc
"Faced with two job opportunities. Hey guys.  I need some advice about a dilemma I’ve been faced with. Hopefully this is the right sub for a casual conversation about my future career..  I’m a masters student but I’ve got a job as well. This job is pretty amazing, it’s a great opportunity with a large company to work within the field of my studies.   I recently sent out an email to another employer, telling them who I was and how I dreamt of changing the world. It was one of those emails I never expected to get a reply to. I’m not qualified for what they do, and all I really have to offer is my determination to “change the world”. However, I got a reply today. Saying they are interested, and would love for me to do an internship with them.  Now this is an incredible opportunity. I could learn everything about the industry and it could potentially be the first step in me fulfilling my dreams. But. (Always a But). To do this I have to give up my current job. My current job is something I do appreciate, and think could have a great impact on the world, but I just cannot bring myself to be as excited about it as I am about the second internship.  So i guess what’s holding me back is if I should play it safe, and remain with my current job where I for sure will have a comfortable career, or jump into the abyss and maybe fulfill my absolute dreams.  My family is telling me to stay with my job, basically saying it would be ungrateful not to. Any thoughts/ideas?"	cc

"everything is building up and I see only one outcome Pretty much just done with everything. My house is a mess because the cats have shit all over the floor and I have no motivation to clean it. I can't use the kitchen because the dishes have piled up. I can't even navigate my bedroom because of all of the trash and clutter. And I can't bring myself to fix a goddamned thing .  I love my boyfriend, but he's just as depressed as - if not more than - me. Between the two of us we have $6. And that's it. He just got moved from full time to part time, also, so our income is about to drop even lower. I work 12 hour shifts and still can't keep up.   I'm 20, have 3 felonies, no college education, and an assload of mental diagnoses. I just want to die because my life is literally shit. I don't go a day without thinking of the shit I've dealt with.  I was molested as a kid, raped as a teenager, and was a felon by 19. People keep telling me how strong I am and how much courage I have. I'm only alive out of guilt. How much it would hurt my family, who I've already successfully destroyed, btw. My boyfriend has already told me he couldn't handle it if he came home to find I'd killed myself. But that's what I want. I tried when I was 16...took pills and drove into incoming traffic. I wouldn't do that again, I don't want anyone else to get hurt. I just want it to be over. I don't want any more bills. I don't want my debt. I don't want this dumpy ass house and sub-par existence.  I want a hole in my head.   It's occurred to me that I would benefit from a lobotomy. And that's about when I realized how bad this all is. My insurance doesn't cover counselling, though. Well, it does, but only 3 visits ""per incident"". And I can't afford past that. So fuck me, right? So that's where I'm at. I'm ready to go. But feel trapped here. Fucking kill me."	sw

Now that I am all done with the visa and everything, I finally feel so excited. Having few friends, I don't have anyone to share my excitement with. So I thought to share this small piece of news with you guys. This excitement however is accompanied by a sense of apprehension.  I am scared about the new environment, the new systems and most of all the complete Independence. At the same time I am looking forward to have a new experience,meet new people and of course, do some interesting research. Writing this down feels awesome.  Thanks for reading fellow Redditors.

"[20M] Almost ready to go. Hello, I'm a 20 year old man from Northern Europe. I feel horrible all the time. My past is filled with nothing but regrets. I can't imagine a positive future. I feel like I'm going insane. I'm so close to killing myself.  I'm being consumed by intense feelings of envy, sadness, selfhatred and resentment. Most of these feelings are related to, as pathetic as it is, my total lack of romantic and sexual experience. I know I'm sort of young and everything, but my past experiences doesn't give me ANY hope that this will change, well, ever. I can't remember a single time when a girl of my age talked to me at their own will. I've had a couple of crushes, both ended up dating people who bully me or act like I'm a subhuman. Not only that, the older I get, the rarer the type of girls I like get within my agegroup.  I know this all might sound like a minor issue to you, but I have pretty obsessive personality, and I'm in very real pain because of this. I can't escape it. I go outside, I see young happy couples everywhere. I listen to music, well, like 90% of it is about love so... I watch Anime, I see young love blossoming. I play online video games, I get called a virgin.  I've talked to my therapist about this, and she doesn't seem to take it seriously, just saying things like ""you'll find someone, I'm sure"". Well, I'm not. Also when I told that I felt that I was ugly she didn't reply straight away, and seemed to dodge the question, which just confirms that I am FUCKING ugly. I look feminine, have big nose, weak chin, bad skin, bad teeth. Only people to say that I look good is my Mom (very biased obviously). I'm pretty skinny, but I can't ""hit the gym"" because of my social anxiety. I've tried buying nice looking clothes that fit me, getting a good haircut, but this just feels like putting makeup on a pig. If happen to find a girl of my dreams, there's just no way she'll be at all interested in me. Which will surely drive me to suicide, if I haven't killed myself by then.  I have two friends, both have already moved away to University in another city, and we rarely talk online (they have better friends than me). I graduated High School last year, a year later than my peers, and am currently studying for entrance exams to university. If I fail to get in, there's nothing between me and the rope. I know my family will be sad, but they'll get over it."	sw
I currently feel down and worse than ever. every time I think I am getting better it's the complete opposite. when I talk about how I feel it's a waste and I want out!!!

"I just heard a new band for the first time today, and they instantly became my favorite band of the modern era. What was the last band you felt that way about? The band is Greta Van Fleet, and I only heard of them for the first time earlier today thanks to a mention in another thread (I gilded that comment in thanks!) I was 3/4 of the way through only the second song of theirs I'd ever heard, and it was obvious to me that this is my new favorite band of the modern era. I'm so thunderstruck. It's almost like they can't possibly be real, because their sound and style are so flawless. It's a Zep fan's fondest and most impossible dream come to pass into reality -  not a cover band, but a creative force of pure Zep sound with that elusive 'is that Robert Plant or not' authenticity and capable of creating that ultimate dream, new material. I bought their album and am listening to it for the first time right now. I keep finding myself sitting in my chair with my jaw hanging open, stunned at what my ears are hearing. I'm so excited about finding them that I really wonder if I'll be able to sleep tonight, and I'm 42 years old.   Have you ever had a song or a band affect you that way? What was it?"	cc
"Does anyone else feel selfish? I have a nice family (except my father, he is abusive), and go to an okay school. My family isn't the richest but they earn enough to put food on my plate and send me to school... but I'm a failure in school and other things also going on, which makes me depressed.

"How do you handle sh*t at work? My co-worker just got promoted 2 levels, even though she wasn't qualified for 1 level up. I'm pissed because we had 3 great candidates for that position, but the hiring manager decided that none of them were good enough, so he promoted her. I am convinced that he is insecure (he's rather young for the position) and didn't want to hire someone who is most definitely more qualified that he is and would likely put him in his place. How do I not be a d*ck to them? I like my job, but now I report to them, and everything they do pisses me off. (it's only been 3 days too).  edit: clarity"	cc
"I’m changing a lot and I’m... okay with it? So for the first time ever, I’m okay with something that’s happening to me.  *woah.*  Suddenly I really like rap music - childish gambino and tyler, the creator especially (give me some recommendations if you want!). Until about 2 weeks ago I thought I absolutely detested rap. I think I just never gave it a chance.   I grew up in a very conservative (not politically, just attitude wise, if that makes any sense) place and now since i don’t live there anymore and socialize with very different people, I’m starting to kinda uncover my actual personality as opposed to the personality that my surroundings gave me.   My one fear is that it’s not my actual personality and I’m just subconsciously trying to conform and fit in. But even if that’s the case, which I doubt, I don’t care. Change is change and I’m grateful for it, because quite honestly at this point in my life all change is good change.  Of course, my newfound love of rap isn’t the only thing that’s changed about me, but it’s the one that I’m most comfortable talking about.   I’ve honestly not liked myself for a long time and I’m sort of just now being shaped into a person that I actually don’t mind. It’s weird, but I like it. "	cc
"My friend is suicidal. My friend is really depressed, and keeps telling me he does not want to live any longer, he drinks a lot, (i fear this adds to his depression), but no matter what I try and say he still feels the same.

"Found a new Youtuber that I really liked... checked out his channel and it turned out he was a white nationalist. I feel gross. The video I watched had nothing to do with racism or politics. But I really liked the style and I watch more Youtube than cable tv, so its always really cool when you find a talented content creator.   I click into his channel to watch other stuff and lo and behold its filled with anti black, white nationalist ""race realism"" and conversations with Sargon.    So disappointing, because the dude had a great voice, awesome editing skills and was a talented writer. I don't want to dismiss ideas outright, but there's a certain line I'm just not willing to cross. When you start elaborating in a neutral accent on the stupidity of black people and refer to them as ""negroes"" I'm noping out.     "	cc
"Anybody wanna talk about gardening? So I just recently picked up gardening as a hobby and I'm having a great time with it already. It's so much fun growing and maintaining plants and trees, I especially like fruit trees and living in California we get a ton of citrus (my favorite).  I find that trimming and pruning trees is very relaxing and meditative and once I get in the zone I can spend hours working on a tree. Unfortunately I live in an apartment so I don't get to have any big plants or trees of my own but I indulge in my hobby by taking care of some of my neighbors trees for them. They really appreciate it and I get to have fun and often get a ton of fruit and flowers to keep for myself.  I love being able to live off the land and may even look into asking my neighbors if I could plant small gardens on their property in exchange for free produce and maintenance.  Anyone else like gardening? if not what is your hobby? and can you tells me more about it?"	cc

"I tried to kill myself yesterday. Where I live it's cold. So I decided to just lay out on the forest side, take off my clothes, to sleep in and never wake up again. I almost fell asleep. I almost did. But a woodpecker woke me up. Then I looked at my phone. My mom was deathly worried where I had been. I broke out of whatever trance I had been in, put on my clothes and went home.  If my family ever knew this wasn't the first time I tried to off myself, they would flip their lid and never leave me alone (something I desperately need). I think about suicide everyday. I make suicide notes in my notebook. I can't handle being alive. Just breathing, just existing, hurts. I don't feel any will to live. If I was drowning, I wouldn't resist.  I really hate myself. I also almost died at birth, and two other times from drowning. By some stroke of luck I stayed alive. But I don't feel appreciative. I feel only dread. Why wont people just let me die. Why are my family so incessant on keeping me alive. I don't want to hurt anymore. Just let me fucking die"	sw
"Can a failed suicide be helpful?. All I know is that nine months ago I jumped off a bridge, and it put a desperation in me that has helped a great deal. I had always been desperately depressed, and had been shoving it down, all my life. Once I finally went through with it, I realized I didn't have to worry about becoming a failure, I was already failing, hard. So fuck it, I have a freedom others don't, because I know I have the balls to do it, and can if I really want at any time. After that working on myself, actually working and making progress, actually happened. I do not regret it whatsoever. The anxiety, PTSD, and autism remain, but the drinking problem and all but the residue of depression, are gone. Am I foolish, or is the idea of such thinking being freeing, or liberating, silly?. I do not know, but it is where I am at."	sw

(I know most friendships don't happen in one night but hey, you never know)  Problem is, I don't know how to behave around strangers. I'm not shy or anything, but I just don't know how to approach a group. The hardest part is to open my mouth and talk and keep the conversation interesting. But I'm just not good at smalltalk.

"I met a nice lady today I was sitting down to enjoy a meal at McDonald's while scrolling through reddit today when a foreign lady asked if the seat in front of me. I know this bit may come as seeming weird (sitting with a stranger? Just why?) but Hong Kong is so crowded that its actually just normal for people to share a table if there are seats left.  So anyways we were eating and suddenly the McDonald's has a blackout--and I cant browse reddit anymore because there's no wifi. So I began talking with the lady sitting opposite me.  I won't mention her name as that might break privacy, but apparently she is an Italian who is a professional Latin American dancer teaching dance in Hong Kong. I talked to her about how I wanted to get into music, but was afraid that I would never be able to compete with how many people there were in music. She told me, ""There are millions of dancers out there, but I succeeded in becoming a professional. You can do it, too. No one will help you; you have to push through yourself.""  I just felt so motivated and hyped after this and I had to post about this. Hopefully this fits the sub"	cc

Had a boost in morale today Been building silos for about 8 months now and I’ve worked my way up the ladder from laborer to lead/assistant foreman. The catch is I’ve been with one Forman the entire time.   So this new foreman comes in today and word on the site is he’s a tough mofo to work for. Extremely critical and a no nonsense type of dude.   So he gets there and watched the work being done for half the day and after lunch he starts to get in on the action. He sees me leading the crew and what not and comes up to me with a question on how to fix the dent in tank. I respond “well I’m just gonna hook a comealong to that bitch and pop’er out”. He takes the toothpick out of his mouth (he’s THAT guy who always has a toothpick in) and says “goddamn son you are a real hanger!”. (The tank is built in sheets and we bolt them up one by one and it’s called hanging sheets. Ergo the hanger).  It wasn’t much but it felt good getting the approval of the big bad boss who everyone’s afraid of.  Have y’all ever got that little comment from a boss or leader that made the day better?	cc

"When your hopes of a fairytale ends For me it was being medically discharged from the military. The diagnosis they gave me, screwed me over really really badly for getting a job in the future.

Just today I got into an unpleasant interaction with someone in another subreddit (on a different account; I don't want people looking for it and starting a brigade)  In short, basically someone's comment was downvoted because they seemed to misunderstand the comment they were replying to. I decided to reply to the downvoted person to explain why they were mistaken. After a bit of back and forth, they replied ""How about you just fuck off dude, okay? Thanks.""  I was pretty taken aback, because I never said any personal insults to them (just an explanation of why they were wrong). I replied saying that I apologize if anything I said came off as rude, and then added ""I don't have anything else to add, so I'll leave you alone now. Bye."" To which they responded, ""I sure hope so.""  Obviously I didn't say anything to them after that. Ultimately I don't have any reason to worry about this anymore, and that person will probably forget about me by tomorrow, but boy, I still feel kind of tense about it now.  Having a random person telling to you to ""fuck off"" online doesn't sound too terrible, just ignore them, right? But it's surprisingly uncomfortable when someone actually directs it at you personally, I just realized (now I get a sense of what it just feel like to be a well-known figure who has much worse told to them regularly)  How have you reacted to experiences like this before? Think I could've handled it better? Got any stories to share yourself?"	cc
"This is the second time I’ve had a teacher assume I was dating someone I was just talking to Yesterday, I was just walking with a friend to lunch, and as I was walking I made eye contact with my old math teacher from last year. She looks at me, then looks at my friend, and goes “she’s pretty, (his name)!” and to say I was slightly uncomfortable is to say the least.    I get that it was probably just a tease, but earlier in the year I was called up by my English teacher and from there she went on about how she’s, “glad me and (another friend) have a good friendship or even a deeper connection, but I need you to help him focus because he won’t listen to me,” like first of all, who are you to ??? call me up and have a one on one talk about someone else’s actions???? like does it look like I control this person???? whatever he decides to do is on his part and not mine. This, at first angered the hell out of me, but I went back to my desk crying from how uncomfortable it it.   I’m just kind of tired of my teachers assuming I’m dating someone just because I enjoy their company. I don’t know, I’m kind of bothered by it to say the least. "	cc
"What phone are you currently using for your daily driver? I have been using my current phone for about three years. It's been showing signs  of aging, but for the foreseeable future, I expect to continue using the phone for a while. I don't have the funds to currently pay for a new phone. To clarify, my phone is an OnePlus One phone. I love it truly. I paid $400 of my hard earned money when I was a sophomore in college university and it's lasted me until now. I love it.  I'll need to save for a new phone soon but curious to see what my options are out there. What phones are you using?  I don't use my phone heavily, only light browsing and video surfing. A lot of redditing, and no games."	cc
"I'd really like to be more active on Reddit I'm not entirely a lurker, but I definitely spend the majority of my time on the site just reading and upvoting.

"Of profession and of marriage. I've become increasingly staunch in my belief that I'll only marry a person sharing my profession. Being a med student , I feel people don't get me and the way I am always split apart from social gatherings due to work or due to a desperate need to be alone after a hectic day.  I always get taunted by people when I decline invitations( I'm very polite in declining them ) or can't reply to messages , by people who aren't related to my profession .  Surprisingly , this never happens among my colleagues.  I know we should 'never say never ' but I'm putting my foot down on this one . Have you felt the same about your profession ?"	cc

Thank god that tomorrow I will have a chance to really debate whether or not its worth going on in this world or not. And in a few weeks there are more problems I haven't dealt with that will inevitably come. Trust me, I know because I've created them.  I'm not going to go into detail on what's happened.

"Can you ever reconnect with an old passion? I have this bad habit of exhausting my favorite things because of overexposure. I can become easily obsessed with things and then drop them suddenly and lose interest. However, what's tearing me down is that I have special things that I can no longer enjoy because I used to be so obsessed with them that they've lost their magic. For instance, I used to listen to certain bands so much that now, even though I consciously like them (I like the lead singer's voice, I like the genre, I like the structure of their songs, etc) I cannot enjoy them anymore because of having listened to them obsessively. The worst thing is, it can happen with people as well. For instance, I fell out of love with my partner of 2 years not because he wasn't the one, but because I was an obsessive asshole and the relationship started to become a burden and a routine. Now we're just friends and I care about him a lot, but I know my feelings for him will never be as strong as they used to be, because that's how things work in my brain. I go through similar phases with my hobbies, not being able to stick to something for a long time. I used to play guitar and paint but they no longer bring me joy now. This is how I am wired:   Become slightly interested in something/someone > Become obsessed > Suddenly lose interest   &nbsp;  I am curious whether you can really rekindle love or not. Maybe you can, with time? Has anyone experienced this? These are more recent examples, so maybe my feelings will change in a few years from now? I don't know. What do you think? Is passion/love something you can rekindle with time, or once you lost it, you lost it for good?"	cc
"Found out that my gf cheated on me with a close friend yesterday. My girlfriend and I have been in a on and off ldr relationship for quite some time now. I seriously loved this girl, still do. She texted me yesterday saying that we needed to talk, and then told me that she kissed one of my closest friends yesterday. When I asked her why it happened and if she had feelings for him, she said that she did for both him and I, and that she was confused. I ended up confronting my friend about it, and yelled at him for an hour straight. God, it hurts so bad. I have no will to live at the moment, and I would honestly just end it all right now if I had the motivation to. I don’t see the point in being alive anymore. She was the only thing that made me see a future past my 18th birthday, the only thing that made every passing day bearable because I knew that she would be there. I can’t even off myself even if I tried, because both my psychiatrist and therapist told my mother to confiscate and hide any hazardous items in the house. I feel as though I can’t even tell my friends about this either, because I kept the last month of our relationship a secret, because I was scared that they would be angry with me when they found out that we were back together. I just want all of this to end."	sw
"It has been a year since my fiancee walked out on me. I do not feel better. No one can give me the life we made together except for her and I'd rather die than live this inferior existence. I screwed up the most incredible, wonderful relationship I ever could have hoped for with a girl who was so perfect for me. We travelled the world together, she was so adventurous. Countless countries, I have photos of us everywhere, doing everything.   I don't believe in anything supernatural, but being with her was so perfect it was like I'd found a soulmate.   Unfortunately a couple of years into our 7 year relationship I developed terrible depression and anxiety due to a really messed up childhood. I tried to beat it a couple of times with sustained efforts over the years but allowed it to consume me too much. When you're that depressed in your worst times you don't realise how much you have to lose and take it for granted. I took her for granted. She worked out multiple times a week, studied hard and got an amazing job, met lots of friends and came home to me at the end of the day.   I put a lot on her, leaning on her for support and not giving enough effort to find a decent job, make friends or take care of my appearance. I'm quite naturally good looking and every time we did anything together we had incredible fun so I guess that was enough for her to stay attracted for a long time but eventually she just saw me as needy and not the man she wanted to be with for life.  A month after leaving me she met a doctor who loves travelling and they have been enjoying the life I always desperately wanted to have with her. I spent the first six months unable to leave the house, a wreck. The next six I worked like crazy, meeting tonnes of new people and going to the gym every single morning, desperately hoping she'd see and have second thoughts. I got promoted at work, although its still not a particularly impressive position. I am in a better place but no matter what I achieve I have to live with the fact that she is gone. It makes everything I achieve not worth it. I have my apartment full of things I want to enjoy with her, it feels so empty. I break down every couple of days. It's not depression. I know depression better than most. It's just pure fucking sadness that she's gone.   I spoke to her a few days ago about what I've been up to, I pretended to be happy hoping that she would see I've changed. She just seemed happy for me and felt comfortable telling me how happy she's been too.   I just can't carry on like this. I am so full of regret, so full of pain. I can be in a room with 10 friends and feel lonely because I miss her. Why live like that? Why?"	sw
"Does anyone have a funny/embarrassing job related story? I went to work yesterday with a sore throat that ended with me losing my voice 1/3 of the shift and I had multiple people tell me how to cure my voice. I received a lot of sympathetic people that could tell how bad I was struggling to talk on the walkie talkie and to other customers. My voice literally sounded like I was whispering when I wasn’t. I’m pretty much embarrassed for the next day I go to work this week. I’m recovering now with lots of tea, lemon and honey. But wow, I wish I called in sick like I did today, "	cc
"Unsure how to survive. I’m new to reddit. So be patient with me while I figure it out. And I posted this in another thread but unsure if it was the right one. Bit of a backstory for you... I’m 24, almost 25. My maternal grandparents adopted me when I was 10 years old. However I have been with them since I can remember. For all intents and purposes, THEY are my mom and dad. It’s been a rough past few years. A lot of cancer and sadness in my family. A few years back, my beloved aunt and uncle both died. (They originally wanted to adopt me however obviously my grandparents did instead), so you can imagine how close I was to them. It was devastating: my uncle hung himself, my aunt died of cancer a few months later. Then I had my beloved great grandma also pass from cancer. Fast forward a year, another immediate family member who I was extremely close to, also passed from cancer. Then a year later, another one, from you guessed it.. cancer.. Every time it seems to get better... my world comes crashing down again.   Every since I can remember, I have had a phobia of losing my parents. I don’t mean a normal fear like everyone has.. we are talking night terrors every night up until 15. Huge separation anxiety issues. Daily therapist sessions, medications, you name it. Still dealing with it today. Besides that, I am (was) INCREDIBLY close to them both. We argued when I was a teenager but who doesn’t. They are(were my best friends). I was always able to let my mom know how much I loved her but for some reason I found it a little harder to vocalise this with my dad. Nevertheless; he was my hero and we shared the same dry, dark sense of humour and love of food and endless horror movies.  In October of 2017, my incredible and much loved mother was diagnosed with a rare form of nasal cancer that had spread to her liver. We were told there was no cure, and without some kind of chemo, that she would be dead in 6 months. She flew back to Arizona from New Zealand for her treatment, as it would be faster and her insurance would make it a little cheaper for her out here.   My Dad and I gave her a months head start then him I and decided to pick up our things and I quit my job, and left my girlfriend, sister(cousin), and life behind in New Zealand to come back to the USA to look after and support my mom and his wife during this time. We were all so heartbroken as yet again, the cancer bug latched itself onto our family. But this time it was to the one closest to me. Devastated is an understatement.  I suppose at this point I should mention that my dad also had stage 4 emphysema and COPD, and even though it was a bleak sounding future. He was actually ok. Managed to get around okay was just a little slower than the rest of us. The second him and I landed in New Zealand, 3 days in, he was hospitalised for pneumonia. And for those of you who are familiar with copd know.. ever sickness big or small to them can be the difference between life or death. He stayed in there 2 weeks. Was out for a week...had to be rehospitalised again for another 3 weeks. Was home for 2 weeks, and ended up back in hospital again. It was clear his lungs were failing and he was getting aspiration pneumonia again and again. He became weak and was so disgusted with himself that he couldn’t even look after his terminally ill wife. He went from a man who was so happy about life, and independence, to a man reliant on oxygen 24/7, could barely talk without his lungs giving out, couldn’t walk, and completely bedridden in hospital constantly. It got to the point where he was unable to eat because of the aspirations as well so in turn he lost so much weight and in turn because even more weak. He was on a bipap 24/7 and it did nothing. All over the period of 3 months. It was unbelievable. We thought he would get out of hospital this last time. He wasn’t happy back in the USA and no matter what, once mom was done with her chemo and if things went into remission for a little while, no matter WHAT even if he was still deathly ill himself... he wanted to be back in New Zealand and die there. However he was told that it would either be intubation(life support) or hospice and the choice needed to be made fast. Dad didn’t want to live with a tube down his throat but also was adamit he didn’t want to go to hospice as to him this meant certain death.   Unfortunately doctors that night were clear with him that it was either hospice or intubation, for which he would be sedated the whole time, as nothing else was working. He was moved to hospice at 11:30pm this Tuesday. Was given morphine and Ativan to relax him and make breathing easier. And died at 8:30 am the next morning (yesterday).

"Coming close now... For the last few days I’ve been thinking about commiting. Literally it’s the only constant in my head making any sense. I had everyone I wanted at one point and it’s all gone.  A girlfriend I loved but lost due to my anxiety and overthinking.  I could’ve been a dad but she had an abortion because I freaked out about being a young dad, and when I tried to make it up and say we should keep it my behaviour had already ruined it. I had a great job but I thought it was too demanding. I was wrong, I could have turned it into a great career.  I’m completely impotent and for a young man, well, I don’t feel like a man anymore. And that not down to my depression because even before this my manhood was failing me! I’ve had all the physical test and nothing apparently.  I’m at a point where everyone around me is successful and I’m just completely broken, I’m tired physically and mentally and just want this to be over.

"I really tried. I tried so hard and I give up. I’m 21 I fought myself to get better I really have. I’ve worked out everyday for the past year, I talk to anyone that sits next to me, I play games and try to stay realistically positive as I can.  But I quit I give up. I fought so hard to give me the life I wanted. I’m just so unhappy and I feel like I built a ladder to get out of the hole and ladder snapped.  I was adopted and by age 10 my parents were divorced, I gained weight, and never had a girlfriend. In my senior year of high school I met someone I fell in love with and it was great I finally felt what life was all about.  Then my grandpa died he basically let himself go and died he was heart broken and depressed with cancer after my grandma died with Alzheimer’s. It was devastating for me and a few weeks later my girlfriend left me for another man and my hair started to fall out bad and I had to shave my head at 20 years old.  Then I changed I worked on myself and lost 50 pounds I found a new girl and made new friends like I said I worked my ass off to get to a place where I was happy, but we broke up today she was seeing someone else. Which is fine since I wanted her to be happy and she told me the truth so I got closure.  But all those bad memories came back and where I’m at now rock bottom looking at everyone I know enjoy their life everyone is moving one and for some reason I just fucking can’t.  I was about to start improving again, but my brain just snapped and now I give up I can’t work myself up again I feel I worked so hard.  I know you work yourself  and fail and eventually it gets better, but I just don’t know I can’t do it.  I’m sitting in bed about to rent out fight club my favorite movie and I have this Luger pistol I got from my grandfather on my lap. All I have to do is pull the trigger and all my problems go away and it sounds so bliss to me.  I don’t want my family all my connections to feel the pain I feel. I’m selfish as fuck for thinking this that killing myself will relieve me.    with just one pull I’ll forget everything and I’m so close please help I don’t want to die. I have no idea why I’m asking for help I shouldn’t need it. "	sw
Calm My body and mind have calmed down now. Would be a nice time to sleep and not wake up. Googling ways to kill myself. How many of my anxiety meds would I need to take?  I don't want to die.

"Nearly died 3 days ago I ate 40 pills of my antidepressants (mirtazepine) last Wednesday. Got driven to the hospital and had a seizure in the ER and ended up in ICU for a couple days, but after I'm actually glad I survived. Recovering well now and I'm pretty much back to normal. Anyways, I've come to realise life's a gift and things might seem like they're constantly declining, but there's always a chance that things can take a turning point. Since then, I've been meditating every morning and it's made a huge difference. I've started focusing on school again, rebuilding relationships with my family, music, and I'm actually happy for once.  Just keep in mind that things can always change (also I'd definitely recommend meditation) "	sw
"I want to do it but I’m scared of what happens next. I’ve lost all hope, I’ve always been a fuck up. I have no one and literally this is the only place where I can vent to without judgement I hope. Basically everyone I’ve ever talked to or known as a “close friend” has always betrayed me, left me for someone better, the 100th choice, my family house hold has so many problems to the point of me not wanting to be there anymore. So much danger and hostility to me. There’s a lot of physical and emotional hostility to me. I’m tired of feeling this way. People are like “oh I’ll never leave you.” Then they leave me very soon after. So yea I’m alone. I don’t really know how to do anything. People always bully me, and I don’t want to speak up in fear of being labeled a pussy by everyone else. I don’t trust anyone anymore. I’m sorry that my problems probably seem very baby to you but to me they are destroying my sanity. I don’t want to kill myself because I’m too scared of what the afterlife is like. Maybe it’s better or maybe it’s 100x worse. Why do I have so much bad Karma. I always try to be nice to others and they all treat me like dirt. People say it gets better but for about 10 years (I’m 20) it’s been all bad. I’ve had dips of good things happening also but the bad significantly outweighs the good things. How do I make all of those go away. Thank you for letting me vent here. "	sw

I still empathize with how everyone feels around me but my mind cannot distinguish what is really happening or what is just happening up here. I even have a minimum wage job and a place to live and family overseas willing to take me in. But i've killed my whole sense of being in this fucking shithole of a city and now my anxiety is so severe i am willing to destroy myself, since that is all that makes me feel alive. I'm fucked up and i blame myself for not having the balls to man up when i should have. I still picture how 'perfect' all this anxiety could shape me up and end up being like a fucking hero in a tragedy movie, but the pain is just too much for any normal human bean to endure. Fuck the last ten years of my life. Everytime i gain something i manage to throw it all away. Maybe suffering is my drug of choice. Maybe deep down i want to feel normal.

"Need help writing a song. I'm looking for a modern day variation of the classic adage ""like a moth to a flame"". Basically, if you're unfamiliar, moths/bugs are attracted to flames for whatever reason. They're attracted to something that can kill them. Anyone know any variations on this old saying?  I'm asking because I'm writing a pop song with this theme, and I want the chorus to be a variation on this similie. I normally just write everything myself, but I'm having trouble getting this song's lyrics finalized. The general vibe of the song is essentially ""it's a sick joke that I can't let you go after you keep letting me down... like why do I keep coming back...wtf is wrong with me... why can't I just drop you"" and I'm kind of half laughing, half crying about it. I'm arguing with myself essentially. I'm simultaneously aware of how irrational I'm being, but I still can't help myself.  The right metaphor will become the chorus/song title and can really make or break the song. If I use your idea I'll give you a writing credit if you want one (bookmark me, this account ain't going anywhere).  Right now the song has a futuristic feel. There's a talkbox in the chorus, and some funk guitar. There's also some wah-wah synths. Lots of harmonies and layers to the vocals. It's just really funky and dancey. The verses are pretty much done, I just keep tweaking the lyrics a bit.  Just figured I'd try Reddit in case y'all have any ideas here. Not expecting anything of course. Thank you!"	cc

She just listened and didn't judge and thats all I needed. A little bit of a break. Thanks NC"	sw
Stuck in bed and bored out of my mind. Recovering from surgery and I’m stuck in bed for the next few days. I’m already bored out of my mind and would love to make some new reddit friends! 	cc
"A new update from my shitty life... I posted this: https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/64lvvz/how_do_you_guys_managed_to_hold_on_when_life/  And later this: https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/6h27k1/and_update_from_me_things_are_not_better_but_i/  So, I did get a great job... and was recently fired from it. I have a new one now, let's hope I'll keep it. At least, the great job I lost allowed me to clear all of our debts, and to put some money aside.  My health is starting to get better... as time goes by, the medication is better (I can now use a threadmill each day!) and the side effect less horrible (I can diet! I lost 20 pounds since about the last update, only 10 more to go to regain my good figure).  I now have severe ostoporosis, but I am taking medication for it... brooke 2 bones in two stupid accidents, so I've had a cast one and off for a while.  My concentration is getting better, my child is doing better. My wife isn't much better, but now, instead of being gone 100% of the day, 7 days per week, she is gone perhaps 50% of the day, 4 to 6 days per week, and no longer needs to sleep 14-16 hours. It's an improvement!  I am now able to follow audio-book. Reading isn't really back yet, but I am starting to be able to read longer and longer.  I spoke to a few FTD specialists on the phone, and it's not clear cut I will get it. My medication DOES cause speech issues, and as a proof, it seems to be getting better rather then to worsen.  Suicide seems less and less like a valid solution. I feel like perhaps, there is hope somewhere.  Plus, in 2 months or so, my child will have 1 year of high school left! That's something!  So who knows! Maybe I won't get sicker, maybe this new job will restart my hope."	sw
"I'm not really aching to kill myself but I'm struggling to find a compelling reason why not to kill myself I know the usual ""think of your family and friends that'll miss you"" but i keep thinking that they'll probably move on eventually, its just what people do. The argument that things get better doesnt hold much water considering how munch constant suffering there is in the world. Some volunteer probably told a whole classroom of impoverished African kids that one day they will grow up to be whatever they wished only to leave them and have half of them die of malaria a month later. Things didnt get better for them and neither did things get better for the girl that kept getting back to her abusive family by a social worker. You cant tell what the future holds and assuming its going to get better is just as naive as assuming its going to get worse.  I cant stop thinking about the afterlife and what would happen if i took my turn to die early. If there is a God like I believe (faith is very shaky at the moment) then i just get to meet him earlier than everyone else. If there isnt a God, then my suffering from depression isnt part of some grander plan and doesnt hold a higher value. People will forget who i am in 200 years whether i die now or live my natural life and end up on a deathbed 60 years from now.  I dont know what to do with myself. I keep assuming my friends dont want to be ny friends because i dont even want to be my friend. I know myself better than anyone and i cant find a way to reconcile the bad with the good to a point where I'm worth redemtion. They only see what I'm brave enough to show them and I know for a guarenteed fact that most of them will quickly turn away from me if they knew everything there is to know about me.  I'm just tired of feeling like I'm just on the verge of drowning, constantly gasping for air, too scared to let myself drown and too cowardly to make a swim for it. I'm going to see my counciler tomorrow morning (its midnight where i live) and i dont know if I'm  going to be able to really figure something out in the hour long session i get before he lets me go and talks to the next schmuck. I keep feeling like a passing memory and that my friends and family and acquaintences dont ever really think about me until I'm physically with them or actively talking to them. They're pleasent enough but I don't believe their love extends further than the immediate interactions i have for them.  Maybe one or two of them actually care about how I'm doing but i dont see them showing it outside of a simple ""how ya doin"" to alleviate their conscience to pat themselves on the back to say that they've done their part. Hell I even went out of my way to call my best friend on the night i was last planning on killing myself and straight up told him that i dont think he's ever gobe out of his way to make sure i was okay, and despite his promises that he's sorry amd is going to make the effort to check up on me from now on i still havent heard a goddamn thing from him in the lines of a checkup. All the promises of tackling life together from my friends get dropped days after making them and none of the concern extends past the momentary release of feel good chemicals they get from extending a helping hand.  I'm just so very tired. Of all of it. My past digs its claws into my to make sure im always dragging it around and my future is so amorphous that all the promises it makes lost their meaning, and as for my present? Well that's a castle built on shaky ground that is ready to collapse any moment.  Idk, it feels good to get this out of just my head but I'm so self defeating that im not sure I'd accept any real help because i dont feel I deserve it. Fuck it. I'm going to get a drink and have a shower. I gotta get as much rest as i can before tomorrow."	sw
"""What"" instead of ""Who"". Hi all,  I think that the world would be a better place if each of us acknowledged ""what"" we are instead of ""who"" we are.

"Something is wrong with me I have struggled with depression almost all my life but I have recently seen that I I have moments were I am a spaz and harm others, and other times were I’m very happy but I talk gibberish and I have a lot of energy.

He refused to believe me. He's only 6.   Before I left, I reminded him that I wouldn't be here next week. He said, ""I will cry"", and my heart melted. He gave me a hug and we departed.

"3am i just need to vent cuz i can’t sleep not sure if this is the appropriate sub for this, sorry  to start off, i am a lesbian.  my girlfriend and I were in a long distance relationship for 5 years, almost 6 she visited me in october of 2017 for what would be the last time; stayed a month and then went home. we had a long conversation about loneliness and family the day before she left. i thought things would be fine.  shortly after arriving home she became very distant with me and blamed it on a sudden depressive episode; i believe this still because she’s had problems with that in the past. she expresses that she is suicidal and of course i’m worried for her. after a few weeks of sparse interaction and me freaking out a lot, she says she’s going to get help and then pretty much drops off the map for me. i am convinced she has killed herself and lied about going to the hospital.  what i don’t know is that she’s blocked me on pretty much every platform, and decided to move on with her life; i did not find out about this until february, so around three months later (after effectively failing to get in touch with her or any family, and pretty much grieving someone i thought i had lost to suicide)  i also struggle with mental issues (bipolar and ptsd) and i felt i could not cope with this, so i saw a counselor and a doctor to medicate me and help me move on. i was beginning to feel like i could move forward with my life, however after finding out she just ghosted me and nothing happened to her, i had a huge nervous breakdown and relapsed.   since then, i have lost a lot of weight from just not eating and i find myself crying constantly, like, inconsolably. i’m unhappy, i’ve withdrawn a lot from my social circle and i’ve dropped so many hobbies that used to make me happy because they remind me of her. i have nightmares about her damn near every night. i have no idea what to do. i really just want to lay down and die.   i don’t blame her at all. i respect her decision to leave me in whatever way she’s chosen. i just don’t understand why i wasn’t even worth a text or a phone call telling me that it’s over. i don’t know how to pick myself up. even when i try, if i manage to get through the whole day without thinking of her, i still have this stupid recurring dream of carrying her body to a train station to go to her funeral but fucking up over and over and taking the wrong trains or not having the money, losing my ticket, etc etc  i can’t even tell anyone because i’m not out to my family or current friends. i figured i’d feel better writing it SOMEWHERE at least.   i know this is like a first world problem, and i’m being dramatic but it hurts so much. its been months but i still haven’t gotten over it. it’s just a stupid breakup and EVERYONE has those. i don’t wanna die but it feels like i’m kind of wasting away anyway. i can’t force myself to eat or take care of myself or talk to anyone.  anyway thanks for listening"	sw
"I'm out soon. I have no desire to be here. I don't think that I objectively could be any less worth. I would make the world a better place by leaving the gene pool. Actually, being me is a-okay until you reach a certain age. I'm about to be 18, but I don't feel mature enough. I'm not socially skilled enough. I'm bogged down by sleep deprivation. I like the opposite sex. It does not even sound that bad, but it's a bad ground foundation of traits to have in life. I'm unhappy with the person that I am and I feel lesser worth.   I only wish the best for everyone else. I want all of my peers to have a great life with a partner, house and a nice job. The thought of that makes me happy, but only if I can be dead at the same time.  I want to give away my money to my peers. Literslly"	sw
2 days My 20th birthday is Tuesday. I don't care if I make it till then. Nobody will remember. Nobody will care. I expressed how I was feeling to my old best friend. She didn't care. She just pushed me away and has stopped talking to me. If I die I will no longer have to stress about school. I won't cry about the fact that I have no friends. I won't lay in bed crying alone. I won't suffer from depression or anxiety anymore. I don't want any of this anymore. I don't want to feel.	sw

This will be my last post so go ahead and send all your hate in the comments and PM's. I'm sure my bfs will find them when he goes through my phone after I die.

"How crazy were you in high school? I'm a senior in high school and about to graduate in two months, and I've never really done anything crazy or super rebellious. It's not that my parents are super strict or anything, I've just never had the drive to. I am an introvert but I consider myself to be pretty social overall. I'm part of a really close group of 7 of us, but I also have other close friends from other random parts of the school that I hang out with too.   That being said, most of us are pretty innocent. A few of my friends that aren't part of my main friend group drink on occasion but it's nothing too crazy. It's not that I have anything against partying or drinking, I just personally haven't really felt like doing it. I'm sure in college I'll probably open up a bit and try new things since it just seems like a better environment for that stuff (no parents, everything is in walking distance, lots of parties to go to...), but for now I don't see myself getting into that kind of stuff.  So, how were/are you in high school? I get the sense that I may be in the minority but hey maybe people like me are more common than I think."	cc
"Subconciously trying to kill myself I've tried to kill myself once in the past and I have a history of hurting myself to deal with intense stress.  I'm living with intense stress for extended periods of time now, I keep myself from hurting me, but as a result I react in weird, self-harming ways and I'm afraid it'll end up turning me into a cripple and possibly hurting innocent people.  I like riding my bike and recently I occassionaly have the urge to kill myself popping into my head. Like not slowing down while driving towards a crossroads. It could be so easy...  Then there's moments where I subconciously disregard my safety, pick pointless fights etc.   Just an hour ago I almost got hit by a car, the car owner was a little shocked and pretty mad and when he yelled, asking whether or not I want to fucking die, the answer in my mind was ""Yeah I guess so"".  Not always are other people involved, sometimes I may just be on a mountain road heading downhill and considering not hitting the brakes. This already happened once and I ended up breaking my right arm and hand with abrasions and bruises all over my body. The medics were pretty surprised my head was unscathed which seems to have been pure luck or maybe survival instinct idk.    TL:DR I'm resisting the urge to kill or hurt myself but I regularly experience brief moments where I conciously or subconciously expose myself to great danger.  I'm afraid to end up harming other people or ending up as a cripple rather than dead."	sw
"I can't do this anymore. I can't do this. Everything hurts. I just keep on smiling when I wish I am crying. The voices are screaming. I'm having panic attacks daily. Most of my friends have left me because I'm distancing myself away from them. But it's not my fault! I can't help that talking, or making eye contact even, brings we severe anxiety. I just want to cut myself so much. I just want to see myself bleed. And having such bad attention makes me have to work for hours just to do simple work. It takes me about three times what ""normal"" people my age takes. I can't focus in class because people keep on sniffing, coughing, clearing their throat, and chewing. It brings me so much pain to hear those sounds. I actually have to count the seconds between each sneeze. Not only real things are hurting, but being fucking schizophrenic is a **NIGHTMARE**. Hearing voices and seeing things makes class one hundred times worse. Not only am I unable to focus, but I'm so fucking stupid. I literally can't do shit. No matter how many times I try to understand, I just don't.  I have ""special accommodations"".  Yeah right. All it does is let me have more time to do things. It helps a tiny bit, but not much. My psychiatrist made my school test me for if I qualify for special education. But we won't get the results till the end of the year.   I'm planning on ending it tomorrow or Saturday. Depending on when my parents leave. Whatever. I just don't give a shit anymore."	sw
Tomorrow. Update. I have decided that I am going to do it tomorrow. If any of you would like to know how or why then look at my previous post.   I am now writing my notes (to friends and family) and I can say that this is the clearest my mind has been in a while. I feel a sense of happiness and joy with this closure but yet I'm terrified at the same time.   Do I feel bad about leaving my friends and the 2 family members that actually love me? Of course I do. To the people that think of suicide as selfish I can see where you are coming from; but until you have lived with mental illnesses you will never understand and I truly hope you never have to.   Anyway. I need to get back to my notes. Thank you all for trying to provide support.	sw

"Weird friends Just wanted to put this out there. My sister goes to an engineering college and she hasn't made a lot of female friends there. Tonight they held a farewell for their seniors and after the farewell, some of her friends needed a place to crash. Too late to head back to the hostels. So she phoned me up and told me that five of her friends would be coming over to spend the night. She's never mentioned any of these girls to me so I guess they're not really close. I prepare my sister's room for three of them, figure the remaining two + my sister can sleep out in the living room. My room is tiny and only has a single so my sister can't sleep in there with me.   Thing is, my sister's room has air conditioning. The moment my sister + girls arrive, I realise this is going to be a problem. Everyone wants to sleep in the room with the air conditioning. So much so that all five girls squeeze themselves onto the Queen bed in my sister's room. And leave my sister to sleep alone in the living room.   Man, I've never been more annoyed at a bunch of strangers in my life. I spent the last hour chilling with my sister and making sure she wasn't too upset about how shitty this bunch of females turned out to be. Definitely not having any of them over again, fuck that.

"I'm Done I did something monumentally stupid while coming to California to help my mom move. I lost the keys to the uhaul we rented. My mom flipped out on me, bringing up the fact that I'm barely working and how at my age, I should be giving her money and not the other way around. I barely work 8 hours a week, and I spent everything I had to fly here. My grandmother offered me money for the trip back, which made my mom angry. She said that I should feel ashamed of asking a 90 year old woman for money, which I never did I just merely said I didn't buy my ticket back home.  Now this happened. I had a bad panic attack from the moment I first realized that I lost the keys. I tore open a bunch of boxes hoping to find them, but to no avail. My mom called me pendejo and said that I'm a lazy bum that refuses to work. If you look at my post history, you'll see how much not having full time work bothers me. On top of that, she said my depression is bullshit.   I'm on my own with this mess. I have no money, and I don't know how I'll solve this problem. Even if I do, I will just go back to being a pathetic loser anyway and sponge off my sister.   What a great life either way...fuck that, I'd rather just end it here."	sw
"After 6 years of doing absolutely nothing with my life, I'm looking at University courses. I mean, I *have* been looking for jobs (unsuccessfully), and it's not like I haven't *thought* about going back to school, but I've never actually looked into it. The idea of student loans always kind of terrified me - regardless of whether I can get help with them - as I'm pretty poor. And I don't have a solid idea of what I'd want to do; extend what I studied in college since I love the subject, or do a different subject I love out of variety, or do something more practical and bland that is more liable to lead to consistent employment afterwards. All I know is, it seems it would be better to spend the next three years studying something I enjoy with the chance for new experiences followed by potential decades of nothing, than *just* the decades of nothing. Anyone else have any experience going back to school? Anyone who's been to college/uni, was the time and money worth it?"	cc
"trapped in my own mind I'm 19 years old and i've been suffering with social anxiety since i was a kid. As such i've never had friends irl, just a couple internet friends that i used to play some games with. I stay from 7:30 am  to 6:00 pm at school and im always alone. No one ever talks to me, i dont have and ever had friends, colleagues, talked to girls irl or anything. I just feel tired all day long and lay at my bed . To make things worse i will probably fail at school due to the fact that im always missing classes. I come from a rich family and i always here that ""i have no reason to be sad because there are many people that would do everything they could to have the life that i have""  One of the internet friends i had was a girl and i started liking her a lot, something that wasnt mutual probably due to the fact that she has a life outside of the internet.

"I got a job! I'm super excited and don't have anyone to share in it with, so Reddit you're gonna get my stream of consciousness.  I've trying for months to get a better job, and after a week of interviews I finally got an offer making nearly twice my current salary!  For the past 18 months I've been working as the General Manager and sole bread baker (crusty sourdough, the kind of old world bread takes 3 days to make) in a small but busy cafe/panini restaurant. It is severely understaffed, to the point where often times during the morning commute rush I am the only employee and have to take orders, brew coffees, make espresso drinks (decades old Italian machine, not a single automated aspect), make and run sandwiches/salads, prep the food, and mix/shape/bake bread. Then also squeeze in inventory/ordering, scheduling, cash management/reports, dishes (entirely hand washed, no machine), janitorial work, etc. You get the idea.  When I took the job initially I had just found out my wife cheated on me and we were divorcing. It was Thanksgiving and I was in a low place. I allowed my current bosses to take advantage of me and agreed to a year long contract before I agreed to a pay. It was only supposed to be for making bread, nothing else. I was hired specifically for my French bread experience. They had previously only been making super sweet spongy type breads (and not very good quality ones IMHO, but I know I'm a snob). I was desperate, moving to a new state, and this job initially seemed like it would be less stressful.  I've never made much money. I used to work in office administration/bookkeeping, but when the 2008 market made me lose my job I decided to go to culinary school so I could at least enjoy what I did at work. I chose to work in kitchens that couldn't pay well, but either looked good on my resume or were places I could learn new techniques.   The owners told me they think my salary of $27,500 is 'more than fair'. As recently as last week they told me they expect me to work 12 hour days if need be to save on labor costs.  I started looking for a new job 6 months ago, but nothing seemed like a good fit. Most kitchens tend to run high with testosterone, and I'm not about that. Or they demand 50-60+ hour work weeks that break your back, and I'm getting too old for that. Good bread bakeries are few and far between. And it's really hard to find time to job hunt while working a full time job that is actually causing you to go further into debt.   I'm in debt up to my eyeballs. My bank account is empty. I'm divorced. I've lost contact with most all of my friends from before I was married. But right now, I couldn't be happier. I've got my two kittens and In two weeks I'll start  making more money than I ever have before. And it'll be the first place in a while I will be proud to tell people I work at.

Posts where redditors are opening up about feeling lonely and down, feeling overwhelmed or needing guidance.   I have had some hard challenges in my life where I’ve needed a person to give guidance, support or just listen.   Many different things helped me. I joined groups of people with similar interests, I made new friends at work by opening up about who I am and what I’m into and I worked at those friendships (I.e; I made a conscious effort to be a good friend) which strengthened them over time.   I know it’s not that easy and there is a lot more granularity to what I did, but this post was not meant to be an essay.   I know how hard it can be; With that said, if you ever feel this way and just want to chat, send me a PM! I’m happy to be there  Everyone needs a friend and if a random Reddit stranger can be that for a short period, I’m happy to be that.

"""How can you NOT care?!"" For at least more than 6-7 years, I have wanted to die, and didn't expect to be alive to see myself become an adult (at least by law). Because I didn't expect to be here, I never cared much about politics, or the future in general, which made me feel absolutely lost when I ended up choosing to live. I decided to pursue the thing most similar to my dream career because if I was going to live, then I didnt care about ending up poor like everyone seems to think when I tell them. I still don't have an opinion or interest in a lot of things, because I try to only focus on what I like and things that normally wouldnt end with someone attacking me for it. Now here's the problem, I have a friend who is VERY into politics, is always trying to talk about it and doesn't like to admit what she's saying might be wrong; because of this, a lot of times I feel like she or other people think I'm dumb for not being interested in important things like that or similar. And it makes me so mad, because I'm trying so hard to convince myself to live and they just see me like a weirdo for not caring about certain topics."	sw

The reason why I'm not over her yet is because my friends and even my parents keep mentioning her to me since they're friends with her and I ghosted her for a whole. After she rejected me I feel like I'm not good enough for this life. I never done selfharm, but I have been getting urges to, since my parents did split 2 years ago, I didn't get depressed until then because she was there for me and I was there for her everything like that.   I just don't know if I can go on, my 20th birthday was last month and I didn't do anything to celebrate it. I gained weight, started binge eating, and I just can't find a reason to continue. Not only that I'm battling a Porn addiction (Yes, it's a real addiction. There's a whole subreddit to it), and I numb myself with that. I used to stay up late with her and we would talk about life etc, and then we would go to work. Now I have no one....."	sw
"I think that is a good suicide note don't you think so ? Ok well, let's see.... Let's explain myself a bit so you will feel good after I suicide. Imagine a table, the table is clean, nothing wrong with it it's super clean, now here is what is going on with me I see the table and I see it clean, but I have to stare at it for a minute or so, then I see it's not clean,I'm pretty sure it's a hallucination but here is the best part, If there is someone nearby to help me I will ask the person if the table is clean or not, the person answers: it's clean, and I say: are you sure?, the person answers: yes, now that helps slightly but now I gotta assume it's clean while it's not because I'm not seeing it's clean I can tell if it's real or not - the fact that it's not clean-, now I gotta do compulsive behaviors for hours to clean that table and eventually will end up free from obsessive thoughts, or realize it's still unclean and panic because all my energy is drained and I can't take it anymore, and when I panic, I gonna scream internally ""End it please whoever is there god or the simulation manager or whoever made this shit up that is not fing fair and I'm not a tool to prove or to test upon I had enough f the system"", I can't take it anymore I can't I just can't I don't care if you say i'm weak, pathetic and you have to fight it or whatever you don't understand you are just being either A)Ignorant about my suffering B)Selfish that you don't want me to rest in peace, so you don't have to get depressed about my death C)You are just following the stupid system, this is like my suicide note okay if you guys should feel anything about this is that I had enough I can't take it and if you reached to here that means, you care about what I'm saying I hope you understand, because I let you down many times and the final let down gonna end all of this, I don't know what to say anymore. sorry about grammatical or spelling problems I just feel down."	sw
"I watched The Big Short for the fifth time I love this movie and I wish more movies followed this format of a documentary drama with an emphasis on truth and style. However, something that really gripped me is that people in the movie keep saying ""that can't happen"" or ""that's never happened before"" or ""they said that would never happen."" The fallacy here is that just because something hasn't happened before, people think it will never happen. It absolutely can, for the better or the worse.  And if people think these things can't last for a decade or more, just ask Greece."	cc

"Everyday im losing my will to live a little bit more I feel like im at my lowest, but i know it will get much, much worse from here.  Things that used to make me happy are now nothing to me, in the past when i was feeling suicidel i was always reminding myself of the things that i love, but now it doesnt work anymore, like i got numb, and empty. Suddenly every time something good happens to me, i dont feel anything, But everytime something bad happens to me, it adds a brand new reason to kill myself, i cant take it anymore, everyday this feeling of emptiness gets 1000x stronger.

"The pile of good things is not worth the pile of bad things I'm not going to do it. But I really wish I could. I know it will hurt my parents tremendously if I do, and I'm all the family they've got. And I don't want to do that to them. But I don't enjoy life -- the pile of good things does not outweigh the pile of bad things, to me -- and I want out. I don't want to have to get up every day and do this anymore.  Ever since I was a little kid, all I've ever truly wanted was a successful relationship with a woman and that's been comically out of my grasp. I just wanted to feel validated and accepted. To have something work out -- be it more serious or casual even -- with someone I can trust. And it never has. The people I've been the most serious about in the last six years or so have just let go of me. Suddenly, without warning, because they had a change of heart after giving me every reason to believe they were all in as I was. They always tell me it isn't me, but if that's true, if I've done nothing wrong, I can't fix it.  It's gotten to where I can't trust that anything will work out. I was carrying on a more casual arrangement recently that even suddenly blew up in a way that felt very similar. I got desperate and started hunting around and met someone online I liked a lot. Even though it was going extremely well, I just kept waiting for the shoe to drop. And this weekend, it did. She wasn't as ready for all this as she initially thought she was. A complete 180 turn from where she was before. I could see it coming and it still hurt like hell. It's almost humorous.   I'm pushing 40 and getting further and further away from the days when I was more attractive to the kind of people I'm compatible with (who tend to be younger; the women in my area that are my age tend to lead very different lifestyles with very different priorities). At this point, I just don't see it changing or getting better. I have no reason to believe it will. My therapist and friends always tell me it ""might"" change but it's getting harder and harder for it to do so as I get older, and the only evidence I have suggests that it won't. Why do I keep wanting to suffer through this for year after year after year?  All I have is my work, and I hate it. I'm burnt out on it, but have very few other options based on my skill set. Mostly, I resent it -- going in to do things, often things I don't care about or object to philosophically, when I get no reward outside of work. I don't want to get up each day and do this shit again, time after time after time. I want to be free of all that.  My friends would be fine if I were gone. They don't like me talking about wanting to go, it worries them, but they have their own lives that are fully formed without me. They might miss me a little but it wouldn't impact them much, and frankly, there are some people in my life that might like to have me out of their hair (my ex to whom I'm frequently in close proximity for social functions, for instance). They'd never say so, but I bet it would be easier for them. The only people who would really be devastated are my folks, and so I'll stay for them -- but that almost makes me feel worse, like my agency is not my own, that I'm bound to them.  And I feel like I'm a sucker for staying in a situation (life) I don't want to be in for someone else when no one else has done the same for me (in relationships ... and no, I wouldn't have asked them to if they didn't really want to be there, yet everyone insists I have to stay alive).  It's just tough. I get little momentary bursts of hope, but as the disappointments build, it becomes harder and harder to even enjoy what I have for the brief time that I have it. And it always comes back to this -- the wishing I wasn't here on this planet anymore so I didn't have to worry about any of this. The heartache. The disappointment. The chaos in general of the world which irritates me every time I see something related to the news (which is hard to avoid, since I work in that field). I just want out. I want to not have to deal with it anymore. I believe I will be in a better place anyway. I'm soooo ready to be done with this shit.  But I won't go. Not anytime soon. Because I just can't do that to them.  "	sw
"I just saw a great movie! So, I just saw a movie called The Passion of Joan of Arc. It's a French silent film from 1928, about the trial and execution of Joan of Arc. I rarely watch black and white movies, but this one was incredible, and Falconetti's performance as Joan was probably the best acting I've ever seen. Anyways, I just felt like talking about obscure movies that most people haven't heard of. What are some obscure movies that you like? I'm willing to talk about anything though, really.

"Lucid Dreaming I’ve been thinking about the concept of lucid dreaming, and how to do it.   I’ve read many articles on how to lucid dream, and I’m going to try it!  But, I have a couple of questions:  1) are you able to wake yourself up? Say you imagine something terrifying, are you able to remove yourself from the dream or do you just have to ‘ride it out’?  2) when you wake up, do you feel that you have actually had a sleep? Or do you feel that you have been awake the whole night?   3) what are the perfect conditions for lucid dreaming? i.e. dark room / laying on your back / no noise in the room that you are sleeping in (for example TV has to be off)  If anyone’s actually managed to have a lucid dream, let me know how it was!   :)  Kit.

"Does anyone else feel a strong sense of bittersweetness when watching old movies/tv shows where the actors were in their prime and then seeing them when they're old? Like I'm only 20 so I wasn't even alive when Friends started airing but I'm only about five or so years away before I'm around the age of some of the cast when the show began. I mean the show ran for 10 years, that's a lot of these actor's lives, and now it's been well over 10 years since the show ended too. I get a real feeling of both sadness but also something nice being able to see these people and other actors when they were young and then in the next few seconds being able to see them fairly old. I think the feeling is amplified when you watch a show where the actors are playing people who are just living life because even though that life was obviously not real, it sorta seems like seeing a real person go through a part of life in the show."	cc
"I just saw a woman at the gas station... So, this is probably more of my internal blathering vomited on to my smartphone, so feel free to down vote or tell me I'm an idiot, insane, etc.  I just feel like sharing.  Also, a question to get the conversation flowing.  So, I just stopped at the gas station to fuel up for the week.  I'm chilling by my car as the gasoline flows, when this newish black car pulls up on the opposite side of the pump from me.  Out of the car steps this beautiful woman.  Nice jacket, blouse, skirt, leggings, and shoes all primarily black with white accents, all perfectly matching her pale skin and dark hair.  I truly just wanted to tell this woman she was crushing it with her look, and that I thought she looked amazing.  However, what's the point?  She's a strong independent woman and she doesn't need compliments, approval, or validation from some random dude at a gas station.  I'm curious about people's thoughts about striking up conversation with strangers in these brief moments of collision that occur in our daily lives.  Grocery store / gas station / etc.  Do you talk to strangers?"	cc

"Yesterday this dude ruined my friend's birthday party So my friend was having a birthday party. Her boyfriend was there (they live together), and so was a lot of his family, including what seemed to be his grandfather or great-grandfather who had tubes in his nose, and his aunties and uncles, and what seemed to be his cousin.  I talked to his cousin for a little bit, and the guy seemed a little off.  Maybe it was just because he was drunk, but that didn't occur to me because the only think they were serving was sangria and soft drinks.  Somehow, though, he did get drunk. At some point I heard her boyfriend go ""YO, [cousin] GET THE FUCK BACK HERE"". At first I thought it was a joke or something because her boyfriend seemed super nice and it was hard to imagine him threatening anyone, but then him and his uncle were outside arguing with the cousin.  The dude was in the driver's seat of his camaro (he drove a camaro) arguing about how he was totally cool to drive and making a big ass of himself. Everyone was totally willing to call an uber for him but for some reason he was being really adamant about driving.  We were cutting the cake, which was ice cream cake (so it was going to melt), when all this was going down and the boyfriend had to spend like half an hour arguing with his idiot cousin and not getting any cake.  And then my friend's boyfriend's elderly aunties were back there like, ""what an asshole, I say knock him out"". Also, the cousin's dad was there arguing with him, saying ""if you drive that car I'm kicking you out"". Dude lived with his dad and drove a Camaro, typical lol.  This is about when I had to leave so I don't know how it ended but I was really glad that his family took a zero-tolerance approach (one of his aunts mentioned working in an ER so that was part of it). Way too many people don't take it seriously, they're just like, ""oh, that's cousin Whoever, he likes to have a few and drive, what a card lol"". Even my best friend once told me with a straight face that his stepdad was ""really good"" at driving drunk and he himself wasn't very good at it. And I'm like, everyone's good at driving drunk until they're not.  It was a pretty cool party otherwise though."	cc
"Anybody else just over it all? I am 45 and have been fighting off suicidal ideation for the better part of 30 years. I even started seeing a therapist and I swear, she's only made things worse. She refuses to give me any antidepressants or help for my crippling anxiety or PTSD. She is condescending and seriously pulled up Google last week during our appt to tell me how to best help my fibromyalgia and anxiety. I almost walked out right then. So on that end, yes, she's gone...finding a new therapist who doesn't suck, but between the chronic fatigue and pain, and the financial difficulties we are facing, I just feel like 45 years was good enough and I would have no qualms with saying goodbye.  Main reason I continue to stick it out is my two adult sons and my husband of 24 years. I know when I've told my spouse about my depression, he just says he'll hate me if I commit suicide. It's rather funny, in a black humor sort of way, as I'll be dead, so why will that really matter? Truth is, I have a life insurance policy that isn't much, but would at least give my husband and boys some money to start a new life. I am sure to pay it every month and have had the policy for over 15 years, so well past any suicide clause. Because of my COPD, depression, fibromyalgia, and other health problems, I cannot up the policy or start a new one as I am ALWAYS denied.   I do work 40+ hours a week and while I like my job, I have 20 years until I can retire with a pension. 20 more years of this life is unbearable and there is no way I will hold on that long. I am a victim services officer and the coordinator for the entire county I live in. The work should be something that stops me from feeling suicidal....I.know...but it doesn't. In fact, often times, helping victims of sexual assault and extreme violence just triggers my own PTSD.   I have been reading through some of the posts I see here and while I think many of you are amazingly kind for your words of hope and your willingness to reach out to help, that is not really what I am looking for. I just want to know what some other coping skills maybe some of you have tried. I feel like I have tried everything and have run out of options for continuing to keep up this facade of loving life. I don't love life, and every morning that I wake up, I wish more than anything that I hadnt.   The depression is just too much to bear and no doctors are even willing to try any antidepressants or anti anxiety medication for me. Even my quack therapist tells me I'm just negative and don't need medication. She doesn't have any idea how close to commiting suicide I am....and she would just tell me suicide won't solve anything. However, as anyone of you who has ever felt suicidal knows, that is not true and often times, when one is suicidal, they have a damn good reason to be and their thoughts are extremely valid and deserve to be heard and respected. So any options for trying to us in a better outlook on life is welcome, but please, I am not here for sympathy or anything like that. I just want to feel certain that I really have given life a fair chance before I end my own. Also, I am not religious, in fact, I hate God and could list a million reasons why and with all due respect, I want to hear nothing about God.

"Help me please. I'm a 20 year old man from the Netherlands, who is turning 21 in a few days. I've been dealing with depression for about 7 or 8 years now.  When I was a teen, my mother did not know how to deal with me because I used to be very hotheaded and hyperactive, which led to her and me having daily arguments. My father was almost always working, so he wasn't often there for me, and if he was home, he didn't want anything to do with his kids. My sister is a person I have trouble being around. She berates me for a whole lot of things I have very little control over (I'll state why later).  When my parents divorced, I quickly started to blame myself over it because I always fought with my mother and felt that I ruined their marriage. I was quickly starting to fail my last year in elementary school and ended up scoring way lower than the teachers expected me to score. Middle school was even worse as I quickly before the person to bully by my class and by a few others which only helped to destroy my already damaged self-esteem and self-worth.  By the time I was in middle school, my mother had a new husband, who was a very abusive person, both verbally and physically. He is now out of my life luckily, but he gave my mother permanent hand damage, he gave my sister a scar on her leg, and he damaged my shoulder and upper back. Whenever I wasn't fighting with my mother or step-father, they were fighting with each other.  I had to go to my father's every two weekends, and half the time during holidays. The first few times went well, where I actually spend time with him, but that all spiraled down once my step-mother came into the picture. I started to shut myself in because she was someone I had never seen before and I couldn't trust new people easily already. My depression gradually and steadily worsened around that time too, and none of my parental figures knew what to do with me. My mother and step-father argued with me all the time, while my father and step-mother didn't bother to ask me if I wanted to do anything and let me just stay in bed all day long. I even stopped joining them for dinner at one point.  When I turned 16, I was taken out of my home situation and I was put in a clinic so I could learn how to fend for myself (because no one had tried to teach me and I had literally no skills to do anything.) While I was at the clinic, I took a brain scan which revealed something about myself that worsened my self-worth even further: There was something wrong with my brain. For whatever reason, my brain is always overactive and takes up a whole lot of my energy, kind of like a burn-out. Over my whole life I got berated by literally almost everyone as lazy when it was actually a medical issue.  Fast forward some time and I was in court as a 17 year old because I originally wanted to remove any form of parental rights over my father because he didn't bother to do anything for me (because he didn't know what he could do), but the judge ultimately ruled for the opposite after asking me, which was that he was forced to seek contact with me.  Around that time, I learned that I am bisexual with a heavy preference for men, which I confided in my mother with her promising to not tell anyone. I quickly learned that that was the wrong choice, as not even after a week, everyone on my mother's side of the family knew about it. My sister literally wanted to cut off all contact with me for being lgbt, which she only didn't because her boyfriend told her to stop being so stupid.  This resulted in spiraling even further down into my self-loathing, and completely destroying my self-confidence and self-worth, and I was put on antidepressants. However, I was quickly taken off of them after telling them I started to see mental images of very gory self-mutilation.  When I turned 18, I was discharged from the clinic and now I live supervised in a home with 3 other people. My father had stopped contacting me completely the moment I turned 18, and by then my mother divorced her second husband. Fast forward 2 uneventful years of me trying desperately to get out of bed in the morning.  My grandmother on my father's side died, which resulted in me and my sister both regaining contact with our father. The contact between him and me is alright now, and I've stayed at his home for new years a few months back. The relationship with my mother is now okay again, and we don't fight as much anymore. However, that's pretty much all the good news that has happened.  My sister and I still barely have any contact, my mother and I barely have any contact, and even though my father and I are on good terms again, the contact is sparse. Financially I'm having trouble almost every month, as because of my brain problem, I'm unable to work, and I'm not eligible for a disability check, because ""I have worked in the past so I should be able to hold a job"", and now that I'm turning 21 in a few days, my alimony has stopped as well. I'm having more trouble than ever to try to get out of bed and go to bed at a reasonable time. I was put on a different brand of antidepressants, but I couldn't bother taking them anymore because they simply didn't do anything. I have one person on this world that I am able to really trust, and he lives on the different side of the earth.  I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm unable to allow people close to me and when they do, I mask my feelings without even thinking about it. I don't feel like I have a purpose to be alive on this world. I don't know if people say they care about me if they really mean it. I feel alone, abandoned, with no hope left. People tell me to ""look for a hobby to occupy yourself with"" but even that's out of reach for me when I get tired after doing groceries at a store 10 minutes away from my home.  I've ended my time with my psychologist because eventually she started berating me and telling me ""you need to start finding something to do during the day"" and ""you need to start working on a sleep schedule"" as if I don't understand that, and the professional therapist I would've gotten literally said the following works to me. ""You cannot be depressed because you said it with a smile"".  I think that I have no purpose on this earth and I'm beyond help. I've been tethering on the edge of ending it and be done with it for everyone's sake, or cling to the (almost) fake hope that someone will find me, pick me up and help me through my problems.  EDIT 4/7: I forgot to note a few things. The few friend groups I'm in, I tried to reach out for help, multiple times even, and every time it ends in one of two things: ""tough love"" and people telling me to get over it basically and that I'm being over-dramatic, or people completely ignoring me."	sw

"nobody would give a damn if i died right now I have no friends. They all ditched me. They all hate me. Every single one. And I don't know what I did wrong for them to stop talking to me but it doesn't matter.  My best friend since first grade, who is also my crush, won't even talk to me anymore. Just out of nowhere he stopped talking to me. They always go everywhere without me and I know that he has parties and goes to places and doesn't even fucking tell me because he proudly posts it on snapchat.  I've cried for help so many times and nobody will answer.  My parents didn't want me. They should have never had me.  If i died right now, nobody would care  The only reason I'm still alive? Because I may not have a ""real world"" life, but I do have an internet life. Yes, I have friends on the internet, but it's not the same as someone who can physically talk to you and hold you.   I don't care if people on the internet ""cared about me"". Bullshit, if I stopped messaging you right now you'd move on. Internet relationships are not the fucking same.  I will never find love, romantic or platonic, in the real world  I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me but obviously I keep doing something wrong, if I can't figure it out I'll just kill myself"	sw

I want to perform on stage with cosplays. I want to do dance covers. I want to get better in pole. I want to travel. I wanted to make the design of books. I want to do paper art.

I hate giving up on things but I know being scattered all over the place doesn't make you an expert. How do you get over this? What do you want to do too?   Also I can't imagine how many dreams people gotta give up when they start having kids. Ugh."	cc
"What's your experience with feeling anxious even though everything's fine? I had a job interview today. It went fine, I guess, but I said some things out of nervousness that are so stupid in hindsight. They offered to let me do a work trial soon, which means that I at least didn't completely fuck up the interview. But still I've been feeling anxious the entire day and I can't even say what I'm afraid of. Even if I don't get the job, it's not like I'm depending on it. I still live with my parents so I don't have to worry about becoming homeless or anything like that.  I'm sure some of you can relate to feeling anxious and not knowing why.

"I've never considered it seriously until today. I've had an amazing life, I'm so fortunate it is really incredible. I've also gone through more hardship than most, not even counting the time when I was fighting overseas. I grew up in a wealthy family, until they lost everything. I've been going to college on my own dime, I've spent 10 years in and out of school just trying to make money and take classes. I was going to give up on school until I met my now girlfriend a little over a year ago. I finished my last project today to get my architecture degree, I presented and it went really great.  Here is the thing, She doesn't know it, but every decision I make is to be better for her. Being completely honest, I'm a really great boyfriend. I also am pretty certain she is going to break up with me tomorrow. Don't know why, apparently it has nothing to do with me. I just never realized she was this important to me that I don't want to be alive without her. I'm not going to tell her I'm thinking of killing myself, I wouldn't put her in that position. I have nobody I can talk to, I've lost any friend I was that close to. I'm not even sure I want to talk."	sw
"Finally committing suicide because I fucked up Dear those who care, I am writing this post, not out of desperation, but because I have no one else to inform about my fatal plan and final decision. And I feel I have to write it down, in order to wrap my mind around it.   Okay. My name is Mads. I am from Denmark, and currently eighteen years of age. Would’ve turned 19 in July. I have for a long time been struggling with depression and anxiety. I’ve sometimes been suicidal but haven’t had the guts to do it, nor actually having a legitimate reason to do it. I’ve been on antidepressants for about 9 months now, and they haven’t helped much. But this isn’t the reason I’ve decided to end my life. Today, Thursday April 9th, I fucked up. Bad. I’m too humiliated to admit what I’ve done. But a police report against me have been filed. I do not think it was necessary, I haven’t done anything technically illegal (just know that), but it puts me in a bad light. But the person filed it anyways. Out of revenge. I informed the individual that it would destroy me and I would most likely commit suicide because of it. And the person responded, that he would gladly destroy my life, and didn’t care that I was suicidal. That was my own issue. Which is true.  I’ve been told by the same person that in eight to ten days the police will be contacting me and or my parents. But I can’t live with that. If my parents find out, they will never forgive me. They might say they will, but deep down I know they won’t. I won’t be able live with that every time time they look at me, this thing will be in the back of their mind. Nor the humiliation.  So, I’ve decided to hang myself. I will be alone from Saturday morning until Sunday afternoon. During that time I will have committed suicide. I’ve decided to do it with my dog’s leash. From the top of the stair railing. I’ve tried tightening the leash around my neck, to see what it feels like. Doesn’t hurt that much. It’s uncomfortable, but I have a high pain tolerance.  It will definitely be successful. I’ve researched it. As long as no one stops me, it will only take a few minutes until I’m dead. I will most likely be doing it in the middle of the night, since the neighbors then won’t be able to notice and stop me. Èdith Piaf will be playing, since I enjoy her music, and think it will be perfect to die to.  These last few days I’m going to make sure are perfect. I want to be happy when I leave. Will be eating my favorite meal, watch some of my favorite movies and tv shows. Might play some video games. Just have a good time. I’m kind of looking forward to it.  So dear strangers, now you know. It was nice to write it down, and get it off my chest.  My time is over. And I’m at peace with that. I’ve had a nice enough life. We are all going to die. I’ve just decided how and when"	sw

"I need reassurance im making the right decision My husband and I adoped two cats last August.   One has been great but the other is kind of a pain in the ass.  She's not a bad cat at all. She's just annoying.  We rent and she has completed tore up the carpet in several spots in the house and our leather couch. She pees in random spots in house (including clean laundry I just folded). We definitely will not be getting our pet deposit back because of her.   She's a very sweet cat but I'm just growing to be very resentful of all the shit she tears up in the house and that's not fair to her.    I've found her a new home. The people she is possibly going to are wonderful. Their cat of several years passed away and they're finally ready to get a new one. Their son's birthday is coming up, so she'll be his present. Tomorrow they're picking her up for a trial week, to see how she adjusts to them. I feel like she'll be a much better fit there.  My husband is kind of making me feel bad about it. Not on purpose, he's just a little bummed out about the rehoming. Even though he's said a thousand times it's okay if I find her a new home.   Im home all day with her, and tbh she's driving me crazy.   Am I doing a bad thing? "	cc

"I want to kill myself. But I’m scared. Which makes me even more depressed knowing I have to live. I don’t know what’s been going on with me lately. I’m so fucking depressed and want to die. I mean I’ve pretty much felt that way since I was a kid but lately it’s been so fucking intense. My “best” friends visited recently and it made me realize how much they don’t even know the real me and if they did, they’d head for the door. The only people that ever really knew me are either dead, dead to me, or in love with someone else. I feel so incredibly alone. I’m currently sleeping with a man 20yrs my senior cause I couldn’t take the Loneliness. I think the whole thing has made me feel more alone though. I wish I could just run away and go traveling again, instead of being stuck in adulthood like I am right now. I’m so fucking stupid for convincing myself I am a normal person that can live a normal life. I need to be able to run away at a moments notice. So many people are terrified of not knowing the future or having no plan. The plans scare me. The responsibility and bills. I just want a full tank of gas and the freedom to go wherever I want on a moments notice. To owe nothing to anyone. To disappear.   Instead I’m stuck in my bed broke as fuck and miserable and missing people who are never coming back. I wanna die. But I can’t. "	sw
"Learning to stay in my own lane has been a relaxing lesson. At my previous job, I had to wear a lot of hats which meant I got involved with a lot of people, and with that came learning about conflicts between people, certain cliques and tensions.

I didn’t realize how exhausting other people’s problems were until I started my new job where everyone’s problems seem so small, now when there’s tension I just stick to doing my job and it’s simplified my work life so much. I felt like I needed everyone to like me or be my friend, letting go of that mindset has really changed how I live my life. "	cc

"Not interested in going on So over the last couple of year the suicidal thought have been growing and growing. After spending lots of time in therapy and having spent two stays in the hospital I have still come up empty. I have been on just about every medication in the book and have yet to really have any complete success. Im surrounded by an extremely supportive family and friends and truly care about them all so much. I myself can have really good day and can enjoy doing thing and constantly try new things in hopes of it helping. I try my best at exercising regularly and eating well enough, but have yet to have it change how I feel.   The problem for me is more often than not,  I do not feel depressed or unhappy. I just don’t feel much of anything. I don’t feel weight down or a failure or anything. I just don’t have any desire to keep going. I just would prefer to stop. After working through this for so long and diving back as far as I can, I can honestly say I felt this way since I was 5 or 6 years old. I’m 24 now and really feel like I’m staying around because I don’t want to hurt my family and friends. I had a sibling take his own life around the same age as me a few years back and I watch it completely destroy my parents and other siblings. I just can’t bring myself to put them through more of that. I feel very trapped in the situation and don’t really know what to do next. I have spent every bit of money I have traveling and trying new places hoping for the best and the feeling has just stayed. I don’t know really where to go from here. "	sw

"Just Don't know what to do anymore I've posted on here a few months ago when I was feeling some of the worst emotions in my life.

I'll be winding up just like my uncle who does nothing but go to work and then come home just so he can repeat the cycle the next day. That'll be me just working some pointless job until the day I die. I wish I had never even gone to college if I knew this was going to happen. Being ""professional"" just isn't a part of who I am, in fact I don't think it's a part of who anyone is. When was the last time you ever called someone that as a compliment? Never. To me that word means nothing but ""phony."" I don't want to be someone who sits behind a desk and forgets that they're not any better than the people toiling away in the factory.

Beyond tired of pretending that I’m ok. Sorry for the long post. This is my first reddit post and I don’t really know how to say all this. I am 21 years old and I’ve struggled with suicidal thoughts and depression since I was around 9 years old. I’ve been on medication since I was 12 and been doing therapy for many years. It helps a bit but in all honesty it’s not making a huge difference. Most of my friends and family think that my depression is just kinda like a sad mood that happens. They don’t realize that I fantasize about dying daily. The only thing keeping me alive is that I know that my death would break the spirit of my friends and family. Which sounds narcissistic now that I say it. Like I’m that important. My two best friends in the world know that I struggle to stay alive and they both are always there for me when I need it. The problem is that I feel like I am not worth their time or anybody’s time for that matter. I feel like I’m always bugging them even though they assure me I’m not. I feel like I’m always needing attention and reassurance that people care for me. I just feel so damn needy and I hate it. I am in love with one of my best friends and we have talked about it and she said that she did have feelings for me but that it would be best if we just stayed friends. Which honestly is ok. I don’t think I am worthy of her anyways. And I love her too much to risk losing her friendship. And I also made her a promise that I would always be there for her. Essentially I told her one time that I had tried to kill myself and as I told her I realized how much pain it would cause. So I promised that I wouldn’t ever leave her. Here’s my problem. I desperately just want to be happy for real. I can’t stand faking it anymore. I want to die because trying to struggle through this is too much to bear. It feels like I’m fighting another version of myself who just wants to end it every second of every day. I don’t know what to do. Thanks for listening.  	sw
"I'm packing for another move I've had more homes than I've had birthdays. I am tired of moving, but this time I am trying to see it as an adventure (when in reality, it is too expensive where I live, and I am forced to move to find housing I can afford). This time it's ""Iowa or Bust!""   Keeping it light, tho. Just looking for conversation when I take a break between bouts of boxing."	cc

"Today is my last day of a job I absolutely dreaded going to everyday. I have somethings lined up but nothing immediate. Basically the title. I am 23 and graduated college in 2016. I had an internship in my field that I absolutely loved coming out of school, but due to company budget I couldn't move up. They let me work way past my end date though and I was genuinely sad to go. I finally left cause this job I am in now fell into my lap, it was a contract but it paid way more than what I was making. It was a hard decision but I left.  Well I immediately didn't like the job and only planned on working here till this summer. This company got a new CEO and due to some restructuring they needed another role in the office and it wasn't one I was all that interested in or good at. So now today is my last day (technically Monday) and I am feeling good. A little bit nervous about being unemployed, but I have some interviews coming up next week and have been going strong on the application game. I really am looking forward to finding a job I am passionate about and one where I can really kick off my career. I don't have debt (bless my incredible parents) and have enough saved up for rent etc. for a few months.   Anyway never posted on this sub before so just looking for conversation about life and if anyone's been in a similar situation, words of encouragement etc.    Edit: Spelling"	cc
"The Jelly Belly Jelly Bean Flavors: RANKED I am somewhat concerned as to how exactly Jelly Belly makes their jelly beans because typically the artificial flavor of the beans are SO strong that it is overwhelming. But necessary if you are eating a variety so that any one flavor can be completely erased from your palette when popping in the next.   My mom had got me a small box of jelly beans for Easter, a variety pack of conventional flavors, and I haven't really eaten these things in years so I thought I'd dip back into my childhood and try them out. Was interested to see that old favorites became today's garbage, and the flavors I used to be meh about have come to the top of my list. Because I’m kind of drunk and bored I will share list of favorite Jelly Belly jelly beans from the worst bean to the best:  * 20: Licorice  I have yet to understand who actually enjoys licorice. I understand back in the olden days there wasn’t as much of a variety of flavors so licorice candy maybe was tolerable alongside like star anise and such. I don’t know how different today’s licorice extract candy is to the licorice flavorings of yesteryear but it is abrasive and borderline obscene. I wonder if at the Jelly Belly lab, scientists did any form of outreach to have kids taste their beans to evaluate which ones stay in circulation. If they DID, then they would throw licorice out. However I have a hunch that Jelly Belly is one of the few corporations that even buy the root anymore and the licorice industry will surely die off without such a loyal customer. I would hate for licorice farmers to lose their jobs over the retirement of this bean flavor so maybe it’s for the best that this bean stays. The licorice jelly bean is as deceptively dark as the blueberry jelly bean so I would have to bite the bean first and get a hint of the horrid flavor so I could know to throw this one away. In hind sight, blueberry isn’t good enough to where this method was worth it. I should have thrown out all dark jelly beans for my own well *bean* hahahahahah get it? Ok,  * 19: Tutti-Frutti  When I was a young warthog, I used to love this fucking flavor. I’d single out the colorful bean and eat them all last, you know save the best for last and stuff? It’s a pretty thing to look at I’ll be honest, the pink with flakes of blue and red, a mini mosaic tile. Sadly, getting older, I’ve completely lost the taste for this hyper sugary flavor. It’s, it’s almost like bubble gum, a flavor I’ve also gotten sick of. I couldn’t do it honestly I threw these in the garbage as well. Thankfully easier to pick out than licorice.  * 18: Bubble Gum  No surprise there. But what IS a surprise is that these beans don’t even taste like bubble gum. Tutti-Frutti tastes more like bubble gum. This is just…off. Askew. It unnerves me.  * 17: Cotton Candy  The pink beans are also suspect and again I don’t know WHAT the hell they thought they were going for but it doesn’t taste like any cotton candy I’ve ever had. Isn’t that bad of a bean but the marketing kind of pisses me off  * 16: Very Cherry  “Very” should be replaced with “Violent”. Yeah, that is a better adjective. This bean is VIOLENTLY cherry flavored. In the jungle, bright colors on animals are sometimes a warning sign of poison or toxicity. I should have recognized the literal red flag that is the overwhelming Red of this bean. Seriously the color is concentrated redness. But of course, artificial cherry candy flavored, and so it kind of made me think of cough syrup.  * 15: Blueberry  Similarly, this is…violently blue. Not blueberry, this bean doesn’t taste like a berry. It tastes “blue”. Didn’t think blue was a flavor? Think again. The Jelly Belly scientists have found a way to extract the flavor of Blue and condense it into jelly bean form. Is it worth it? It’s ok I guess, but off putting.  * 14: Watermelon  A favorite summer moment is getting to sit out on the patio, feel the wind blow over me, and look at the trees and the vibrancy of the grass, and snack on grapes and watermelon. I like watermelon. This bean is not watermelon. I don’t know what actual flavor the artificial watermelon candy extract tries to emulate, but it is so far removed from the actual fruit that every bean I ate made me long for those summer days, for the juiciness and natural flavor of a true watermelon. I cannot wait for those days to return here.  * 13: Green Apple  What is with these fruit jelly beans? They are almost a mockery of the fruits which they imitate. Though it does taste very “green”, there is a bit more of a nod toward actual “apple” flavor.  * 12-8: The Citrus Fruits & Peach  Orange Sherbet, Sunkist® Lemon, Sunkist® Tangerine, Lemon Lime, and Peach all fall in the middle of the list because all are equally boring. Ironic because citrus fruits have vibrant flavors. Here I just feel meh. I feel so bored every time I’d pop a yellow or orange bean into my mouth, I’d think “oh boy I bet this will pucker the lips a bit” and I feel numbness inside of me because I think I am a grown man eating jelly beans alone in his room. I have nothing much to say about each individual flavor.  By the way? I have been calling “Orange Sherbet” “Orange Sher-bert” for years now. YEARS. No one has corrected me. I had to type “Sherbert” and get the red squiggly line to alert me that something was wrong.  * 7: Sizzling Cinnamon  The common theme you will see as I get closer to one is that for the most part, the more artificial the flavor is, the more I enjoy it. Which seems counter intuitive to me, I felt that as an adult I would like the fruit ones more. I think rather I appreciate when candy is trying to be candy, and not pretending to be fruit filled. The cinnamon one is good, makes me think of big red which I enjoy. Or like those mints.  * 6: Juicy Pear  An exception to the fruit hate. The actual bean looks a bit sickly, it makes me think of the booger flavored beans in Harry Potter. However, somehow, it works. Somehow, it does feel like a bite of a juicy pear. But better than a pear because pears themselves are somewhat boring, so the added sugar makes it higher on the list than most other fruits.  * 5: Strawberry Cheesecake  Impressionism was an art movement where painters would create scenes that weren’t fully fledged out in details, literally giving you an “impression” of a scene. More than that, it was their subjective impression of a scene as well. Similar traits can be heard in the music of Debussy and Ravel, who paint using music to portray impressions of Greek Myths, of foreign lands, etc. etc. I would say this bean is impressionist. It clearly isn’t a cheesecake. But you get the hint of strawberry, you get the hint of the dessert, and it is almost into the uncanny valley. Something is off, but it’s ok. This bean was probably crafted by an artist.   From this point forward I’m willing to say these beans are more examples of Impressionism in food art.  * 4: Coconut  The last fruit in the bundle and it’s the best. The white bean is a treasure. So simple, and calming, like white foam over the waves, like sand, like, well, a coconut. Biting into this makes me think of sun lotion, of being by the pool, of taking in the warmth of the sun. A bite-sized vacation.  * 3: Pina Colada  This will follow Coconut in description. Eating the cocktail themed bean makes me think of Puerto Rico and indulging in treats I can’t normally get here at home, feeling more relaxed and happy to be away from it all. Another vacation themed bean.  * 2: Toasted Marshmallow  I don’t want to know how the Jelly Belly scientists were able to extract the flavor of toasted as well as marshmallow and make it work in a way that isn’t overwhelming. It is just right, just the right hint of toastiness and marshmallowness. It does make me think of campfires, of looking up at the stars, of shivering in the cold, ghost stories…somehow all of my favorite October memories as a child is recreated through one bean. Kudos.  And finally, the King of Beans:  * 1: Buttered Popcorn  I do not understand how this flavor got to the top of the list. From just the name alone, it feels like a warning sign. Saccharine, unnatural, wrong. But somehow, SOMEHOW, the genius scientists were able to make an icon of movie theater popcorn. And by icon I don’t mean like “the iconic well known flavor”, I mean how the Orthodox use it. An ikon is a depiction of God in art, and this bean is an ikon of movie theater popcorn. I don’t understand how they were able to make a transcendent flavor like this. The scientist, nay, artist, who crafts this bean, probably has a loving family, he or she is probably fulfilled in life, sleeps peacefully. If not, you deserve it sir or madam. You deserve the good things that happen in your life. The life, the light, the love in me honors the life, light, and love in you.  And so ends my time-killer for the day. I hope you…enjoy? This. Also? If anyone from the Jelly Belly corporation is carousing social media for marketing research or whatever, and the title of this post triggers you to read it, know that I will be ready to promote your beans on this site in exchange for a lifetime supply of the following flavors:  * Buttered Popcorn  * Toasted Marshmallow  * Pina Colada  * Coconut  * Strawberry Cheesecake  * Every Licorice bean in circulation  The last isn’t because I want to eat them, God no, but rather I want to save others from having to come across them.

"I'm on the brink and I don't know how to get out of it I'm so scared of myself right now, I'd hurt so many people if I killed myself, I have a loving, supportive family, but they don't know I'm like this. I'm sick to death of myself, and right now I feel as though I could finally do it.   Months ago I thought about how and where, all that's left is to have the courage to actually do it.   I know that I almost certainly won't, I'm not strong enough, too scared of hurting the people I love, I feel so selfish for even thinking about it when I have so much love in my life, I just don't feel like my being alive is benefiting anyone.

"Happy Yet Suicidal Hey everyone. I’ve been a lurker on Reddit for a few months now, and while I normally don’t like baring my whole soul to people online (not because I fear being made fun of, but because I don’t like bringing people down with me that I don’t know), I’ve just been being eaten away at by my brain for a while now.  So I finally am happy. I mean, at least as much as a depressed person can be. I reconnected with my best friend, who is also the love of my life, and accepted that I won’t be with her ever, my other good friends are in alright spots and, like me, are slowly overcoming their own issues, and I’m living for things that make me happy.  However, it’s not perfect: my nana was diagnosed with cancer recently (lung that metastasized to the brain and colon I think was the other, with one lung on stage 4), and I haven’t had that really feel real yet. Everyone I talk to someone, something doesn’t feel right, and it’s not like in the past where my social anxiety made me feel like they were angry at me. More like they just don’t care, but I know that’s not true. I’m failing this semester despite the best attempts of my teachers to try and help me, and it’s because I fail to gather the motivation and hate my major. My parents are both on me about both doing well and being social to help my depression, and I’m slowly wanting to turn to drugs to forget I exist to take the spot of my poor eating habits I’ve had and still do.    I know this sounds selfish and like I’m not really happy and maybe I want what no one can have, but I’m as happy as I’ve ever been knowing that I have people I love in my life. But I still find myself thinking about suicide and craving drugs, and tonight I skipped class to just sit in my car and pretend I’m there for my parents. I feel like a wreck and a failure, and I have for years, but I am finally happy and still want to die. Does anyone else feel this way?  I’m sorry this was long winded, I just needed to say something I guess. And with all my friends busy and not wanting to admit some of my issues, this was all I had to not turn to my darker thoughts. Maybe this doesn’t belong here, but I just wanted to share. Thanks everyone."	sw

"What small things make you feel good? I work on a cruise ship and currently there are two of my position onboard. The other guy is a good friend and we have worked together before.

I’m not inactive at all as my job is in theatre so there is always something physical to be getting on with, however I’m not exactly fit  Today on my way back from getting coffee at the back  of the ship I bump into this friend running on the open deck. “Come on, pick up the pace Matt” he jokes. Well sure, fine. Why not. Get back to my cabin, change out of my uniform and into my running stuff (that have been unused in a fair few weeks) and catch up with him. Some 20 mins later I’m still running at his pace (and if it wasn’t for some bad life decisions could of kept going).  I ran on the open deck with a friend, throughly enjoying myself and life.

"Looking for a way out, again... A little bit of information about me, I'm an eighteen year old Male, 3 previous hospitalizations, been depressed since I was 12, I was raped when I was 9 by my neighbor. The rapes continued on for about 2 years.  I keep having flashbacks of what happened to me when I was little, I never thought anything of it at the time, he said is was a ""game.""  He always let me play on his phone or something like that afterwards. When I was around 12-13 I realized what actually happened to me, I never said anything to anyone because I was too scared. I can't even fall asleep without drugs anymore, which I can't even get ahold of on my own because the last time I tried to kill myself my parents locked up all the medication in the house. I'm thinking about taking a car in the middle of the night and parking near the train station and just walking down the tracks. My therapist doesnt help me. My parents say they care about me, but I have a hard time seeing it. After my last attempt most people at my school ignored me. I'm just sick and tired of being ignored."	sw
"Does anyone else ever dream of the future and see it happen? I don’t know if it’s just me, but sometimes I dream of the future with somewhat blurry clarity.

"Did you ever grow out of your stinginess? Currently, I find spending money really hard. I hate the idea of spending money, so I rarely do. When I go out shopping with friends, I usually always buy a few things unless it’s from a thrift store. Even when I go out, I the price of the meal I’m getting always matters. Even when I’m paying or when I’m not paying. I hate spending other people’s money, too. I’ve even opted out of school extra curricular because I didn’t want to spend the money. Things can cost as little as $10 and it’ll take a lot of convincing for me to buy it.   I’ve thought about this a lot recently, and I made the realization that when I’m older and living on my own, I still can’t be not spending money. It’s not that I don’t have any money, it’s just that I hate spending it because it makes me feel bad.   Were you stingy when you were younger and grew out of it? Have you become more stingy as you’ve gotten older? What’s been your situation on spending money? "	cc

I didn't feel it. I'm an emotional wreck and in all honesty I dont exactly know why. It's probably because I'm not taking my prozac. But does 40mg really make that much a difference.

Then I'm here using the point/tip of the blade which I swear wasn't sharp to just doing a flicking motion across my arm. And now I have 3 nice little cuts. But I didn feel it.

As I gaze up at my stars on my ceiling, feeling my body become lifeless finally taking my last breath. "	sw
"I don't like gravy. No really, I really don't like it. Never have. I can't really explain my reasoning for it, but every time I've tried to enjoy it I never do.  Quite a few foods/drinks I don't care for either, like tea, but that's for another time."	cc
"Does anyone else get anxious when replying to texts, even casual texts? Does anyone else find it super-nerve wracking to reply to text messages?  I don't have social anxiety by any means; I love to socialize and chat face-to-face but text messages make me super anxious for  some reason.   I'll procrastinate replying for days (if I reply at all) and I'm never happy after sending one. This isn't just in regards to serious conversations,the text I receive can be as casual as, ""check out my llama socks!""   Does anyone else do this?   ---  **Edit:** I never expect this conversation to blow up. I'm sorry for posting another one of those ""does anyone else..."" threads as I genuinely thought this would just be a chat between me and a handful of casual conversationers.  I'm relevied to see I'm far from alone. I'm even happier to see so many people have overcome this weird anxiety!"	cc
I’ve prayed nearly every night for death for a few months now.. I can’t take my life. Would tear up my family but I’m tired of being here. I’ve been praying to GET cancer which I already know is shitty as it ruins a lot of people’s lives.. but please... don’t make me hurt myself.  I just wish I could give someone my life span in exchange for someone dying.  I’m actually extremely healthy - scary healthy for someone who feels so shitty and it’s a curse for me. 	sw
"So tired and lonely. I’m a 36 yo french dude and I live with my mom.   I’m unemployed, broke, constantly tired.   People say I’m handsome, kind, smart and I have good social skills.   Haven’t had sex in 6 years. Haven’t had a real gf in 18 years. Have no friends. No driving license.   I love working out. Lost lot of weight these past few months, gained muscle, and recently stopped smoking and fapping.   Still, all these new habits and victories of the will are but a short a respite from my ever looming depression and self loathing.   It seems I can never find the strength to do anything with my life. I’ve spent years living in my bedroom fantasizing about life’s possibilities, occasionally taking actions which mostly result in failures.   These days I don’t seem to be able to find the strength to keep going. I don’t feel that it’s worth it.  The loneliness and sexual frustration are just so painful I numb myself with xanax. The only thing that keeps we trying is knowing that it would be a huge waste of potential.  On the brink of saying fuck it though.   "	sw

"The Hungarian language has more than 20 words for the same nasty thing... I love my language. It's beautiful and very descriptive. We have a lot of words for things that other languages don't even have one. My favourite word like this is ""bölönc"". There are more than twenty words for this thing:           *betyárkörte, huszárkörte, peternác, labanctallér, szárazszemölcs, gatyazsír, hunyormag, legénytallér, mexikói gombóc, pölönc, szőrmeggy, zsiványkörte, csibésztallér, rablómazsola, csibészborsó, partizángolyócska, zsiványmazsola, huszárlepény, cimborapogácsa, csimasztallér, bélsárkányfog, betyárgumó, seggcsimbók, szarcsimbók*         Now, what is the meaning of bölönc? It's basically a piece of poop that dries on your butt hair if you don't wipe properly. I think the English word for it is 'clinkers' (Source: urbandictionary)      I just find it interesting (and disturbing) that we have so many words for this one thing... Makes you think...         Edit: My absolute favourite is 'bélsárkányfog' which roughly translates to 'The tooth of the boweldragon'."	cc

"The deafening question: Should I stay or should I go? I’m at a seriously pivotal point in my life. I’m 25, in a committed relationship, just signed a new lease and bought a car, I’ve accomplished so many of my goals within the last year.... and I just have this overwhelming sensation to go. To run and abandon it all.   I’m not sure why. I don’t think leaving would help solve anything. I’d probably be more sad, than I would be relieved. But the mundane life I’m living right now is terrifying me. Maybe I should have dreamed bigger? Or like, chosen to never settle.   Do you ever feel like this?

"Some questions for Easter! With Easter coming up, I thought I'd share some questions:  1. Do you still go to Easter egg hunts? If not, when and why did you stop? 2. Has anyone here ever attended an adult Easter egg hunt? If so, what was it like? 3. Any interesting Easter-related stories you want to share?  I'll start:  1. I stopped going to Easter eggs after 6th grade. Although nobody told me I was too old, I felt it would be weird to keep going to children's events after elementary school. This was 20 years ago. 2. I've never been to an adult Easter egg hunt but am definitely curious about them. I definitely miss the feeling of searching for those colorful eggs. 3. I occasionally stole eggs from other kids to give to those who arrived to late. I'm Robin Hood, y'all!"	cc
"I miss touching people Had a rough breakup sort of recently (I guess), and I miss human contact in that way. I usually don't like people touching me and get uncomfortable, but it's just different, you know? It's been so long since I've gotten a hug. And not a hug, a *hug*. Like I'm sure I could get a hug from someone if I really wanted to, but it's not really the physical aspects that I'm missing. I mean a little, yes, but also the emotion behind it. Sorry if this is a little money, just felt like I needed to say it somewhere"	cc
"I'm gonna try and learn Japanese I've heard it's hard, but hey, I need a challenge for my lazy self.  I'll be honest, I mostly want to learn cause I love anime ***but*** I can also use it as a qualification to get a job, so there's a legit reason on top of the ~~better~~ more cringey one.  I only know 1 language, as is custom with Americans.  I could learn Spanish, but I feel like so many people know Spanish that I won't stand out as much as if I spoke Japanese.  I'm going into college this fall, so I think I'll set a goal of being able to hold a casual conversation by the time I graduate.  I think that's a pretty reasonable goal, since I've heard it's one of the harder languages for English speakers to learn.  Maybe I'll get beyond that, idk.  We'll see.  What goals do you all have for yourselves, short or long term?"	cc

"I would’ve done it tonight if I wasn’t so afraid of what comes after. I’m just going to vent, you don’t have to read if you don’t want to.   I’m a 20 year old girl in college. I lost two good friends to suicide. The last one I lost two years ago on March 19th and it’s not gotten any easier and the idea of being with her somewhere makes it sound much less scary. I’m just so tired of not being enough for my family and friends. I’m so alone. I have friends but they only want to talk if they need help but if I come around basically pleading for help, no one is there. I just don’t feel that anyone would miss me because no one really knows I’m here at this point. I know how ridiculous that sounds. Ever so often, more often now than ever before, I have these fucking breakdowns and anxiety attacks where nothing at all matters to me and I just fall apart. I used to self harm and I’ve been clean for several years but no matter what, whenever anything goes wrong, it is always my first thought. I’m so sick of living my life as this anxious lonely person. If I could, I would do it right now. I’m scared for my family but I know they’d be able to move on. I’ll also have random bouts of recklessness where I just want to wrap my car around a tree or drive off a cliff. I don’t even realize it’s happening until I’m about to do it. I know I need to talk to a professional but I’m scared they’ll lock me up or diagnose me with something that’ll go in my file and ruin my future. I don’t know what to do anymore.   TLDR; I’m sad and want to die but I can’t go through with it."	sw

"I went to a float tank and got a call from my dead mother. What are your experiences? I’ve tried float tanks 3 times now. It’s also called a sensory deprivation tank for those who clicked this not knowing and I highly advise giving it a chance.    My first time was “meh” because I couldn’t get in the zone. The second time was way better but the third I came out smiling and crying. I figured eventually I would have one of those moments. I figured right.   I know it sounds crazy but I heard her voice. She died in a horrible car accident in 2013 and was chiming in to my session to let me know she was safe. I told her I knew. She then told me how proud of me she was. The connection was spotty but again I told her I knew. True to the way my mom was she apologized for interrupting my session, knowing I couldn’t totally zone out with her there. We said goodbye. About ten minutes later (I may have actually said this out loud) I could tell she was still there, “mooooooom!” , she laughed “alright, alright. I’m going!”  <3  Just curious what experience others have had. "	cc
"I feel so differently this time. Thoughts? Hey ya'll,  Like so many of the people in this community, I'm not a stranger to embracing the idea of nonexistence. But every time I've felt like now was the right time to end my life, it's been a driven, passionate experience. A kind of push to escape the pain of what I was feeling.  Again, just like everybody else, during some of the darkest parts of my depression I found myself convinced that the pain was never going to stop. That the only way it would ever be any better was if I took matters into my own hands and stopped feeling anything at all. Suicide was the ultimate painkiller, something I carried in my bag next to the ibuprofen, something I could use to cure lifelong agonies rather than just headaches.   But these past few weeks have been a very different affair. I've come to feel that there is something that sets me apart from other people, namely that there is a lack of vibrancy, of color, of depth, in my life. I see a passion of experiences in other people that I haven't been able to feel for a very long time.   This realization has encouraged me to get my affairs in order, but I find myself at a crossroads. As I care so much more about handling things responsibly now, I've had the time to really examine how I want my life to be handled when I'm not around to life it.  As with any suicide, there comes a point when I have to make a choice I can't take back: quitting my job, leaving the keys to my apartment with the landlord, things that would put me on the street if I didn't follow through.   So in a much smaller way than pulling the trigger, all the pressure of following through with my choice rests on something much less significant than taking the final step over the edge, or kicking the chair out from under me. I'm struggling with feeling completely at ease with making those choices, though I'm not sure anyone ever really does.  So, like the title says, thoughts? "	sw

"I can’t take it anymore This entire sophomore year has just been hell. I failed out of my honors Spanish class, basically dashing any hope of taking AP Spanish as a senior. So now I am in an A-Level class.  And as of now I cannot keep my grade above a D in math or chem. Everyone else seems to get decent grades without even trying and it seems that no matter how hard I try I can never get straight a’s. One person in my math class consistently gets 100s on math tests, and I just feel so annoyed. I study, I do the homework, I stay after school for tutoring; I am the perfect student but my grades can never reflect that. I nearly failed out of Chemistry the FIRST SEMESTER, and to add the cherry on top. I failed the midterm despite agonizing over my grades nearly every school day. No matter what I do it is never enough. It’s never enough. Whether I study everyday before a test, or don’t study at all I can never get the grades I want no matter what I do. Today, our teacher gave us a pop quiz on a topic that we learnt two weeks ago, and my mind went blank. That grade will certainly drop me back down to an F, undoing everything I had worked so hard for this semester. It’s the 4th quarter of the year and I can’t take it anymore. I just want to kill myself so I won’t have to see the rest of this miserable semester through. I hate myself so much. Putting effort into school is nothing more than a waste of energy. If I go to my school counselor, she’ll just start going on about how I shouldn’t give up and that I still have my junior and senior years ahead of me. I feel that my life is already over. If I can’t pass high school math or chemistry class how on Earth am I supposed to excel in college or living? Cheating is not even an option because my teachers space the desks 3 miles apart. Dropping out is entirely off the table, because of my parents. Everyone keeps on saying that I should keep working hard and I shouldn’t lose hope. As my grades drop, I can literally feel myself losing the will to live.  I just can do this anymore. Everyday hoping for some kind of improvement, only to fail hopelessly.  Update: Just failed another chemistry pop quiz. Now I wanna slit my wrists when I go home."	sw
"My story I'm 16 years old, ever since i was 10 i hated my life, i would think about killing myself but not in a serious way, my mom had breakouts in front of me saying that she would kill herself, and throwing shit everywere, screamming at me, i think thats why now i can't show compassion to her, i like her but i just want to get as far away from her as possible, thats why i live with my grandma and my aunt, i know my family loves me, but i can't show love to them, and seem to hate them. My best friend is rhis girl that i really love, and she really loves me but only as friends, we dated about 2 years ago and ever since then i have liked her (she knows that i like her), and for those 2 years she has made out with lots of guys, sometines she would tell me that and i just got miserable, today she told me she had a bet to make out with 10 different guys, and she made out with 5 this month some of them guys that i know, the guy she likes is a real douchebag, and even knows about the bet, i love her, i fell my happiest when i talk to her, and she is just a bitch, i can't stand this, i have liked for 2 years recently i got some hopes that she liked me, just to have them thrown away, i am miserable, i regret almost every single life choice that i made, i don't have any female friends other than that girl, the only sexual encounter that i had since her was with this ugly girl that i lost my virginity with, i regreat that soo much, when i look baxk at my life i see nothing good, i just failure and losses, i am miserable now and i cry every day, the things i loved before are just boring now, the only things that make me happy us talking to that girl and talking to my real friends, i am now addicted to tobacco i started smoking to calm myself and now i can't stop, i keep thinking today is the day i stop, but i just get depressed and end up smoking, sometimes i smoke weed or cheap hash too, my real friends are the string that holds me from ending it all, every time i leave the house i hope i get runned over by a car and everything just ends, i don't want to stop writing this, i don't to go back to miserable life i have, i have nothing to hope for, i'm not a good student, i love exercise and i'm really athletic, but im so depressed i can't even go to the gym or exercise, i don't have the motivation and will probably start crying once i get there, i want to die but i don't have the guts to do it myself, i don't know what to do, i'm scared to tell this to anyone, because i fell like i can't trust anyone, i never thought this would happen, i can't take much more of this, theres is a shotgun that belong to my grandfather before he died, i just need shells and i can end it all, i'm so ashamed of myself for letting things get to this point, i love a total bitch, my life is full of bad decisions and regreats, i hate my family, nothing makes me happy anymore, and the only thing that keeps me away from doing it are my friends who have no idea i'm like this "	sw

"Kids fly to the moon in a day So as a kid I would love to tell stories I made up to my cousins. Before going to sleep I would stand up and narrate a story to them. They would always laugh at the stupidity in my stories (I am the youngest) and I would think they are laughing because they enjoy it. Out of the many stories I told them there is one we will never forget!   The story is about a pair of siblings. A brother and sister. Their father was an astronaut. So one day he comes up to his kids and tells them he’s taking them to the moon. Before going to the moon the kids discuss what the moon must look like and they both come to the conclusion that it is made of cheese. But when they land on the moon in a day they realise they were wrong. They still enjoy their time on the moon and eat the Maggi noodles packed by their mom when they got hungry.   After an amazing time on the moon they come back to earth. One day as they were playing they find an unusual but familiar rock.  “This rock has fallen from the moon!”  The brother exclaims.  The kids discuss what to do with it for a while and decide they should go tell their father and take it back to the moon.   So they go back to the moon, again in a day. When they reach, they take the piece of rock they found and stick it to moon with feviquik (super glue) "	cc

"I am done. I hate myself I am STRONGLY considering taking my life tonight. I will OD on drugs most likely or just go into the woods and starve to death.  sry for the long rant and lack of proper formatting   I am basically lying in bed all day every day and rotting my life away for YEARS now.. I have thoughts on my mind 24/7.. my mind is racing yet I am feeling dull and nothing affects me.. my whole life has been a waste.  I feel like nothing is real, nothing interests me, nothing excites me, I don't have any life energy left inside of me. I am not a person anymore, just an empty shell devoid of any real life.. my heart and organs may function, yet my brain constantly is fogged and poisoned with bad thoughts.  I have been alienating all my friends, my family is broken, and I have never had a girlfriend ever and I wont at this point. It is impossible. I am a short person at 172cm and my personality is a complete mess. That is what 15+ years of being depressed can do to you. I am such a different person to who I used to be.   I am deeply unhappy with every single cell of my being. I was always obsessed about my looks going to the gym and watching my nutrition, but for what? I was always unhappy in my own skin, I could never satisfy my standards, I always wished I was someone else.. I wanted to live, I just never wanted to live my own life. Nowadays I just don't want to live, no matter what.  I am a narcisst and I am my own worst enemy.. I dread every day, I can't even watch movies or read or do anything.. I just stare at the wall and sleep, wake up, sleep again.   I have no dreams left. I am rapidly getting older, I realize my best years have been all a waste, I have nothing to look forward to, I should have taken my life years ago already, but I am a coward as well. I dont want to live yet I dont want to die, I just want to be DEAD without the process of having to die.    I have been fighting every day to somehow reach my goals of making at least a bit of money through different things.. and then I lost almost all of my money the last week, while I was blackout drunk. Or maybe it got stolen. I am 32 years old and I am a complete mess at this point. I am ashamed of myself, so I will always tell lies about my life to people that don't know me very well.  Nothing ever goes right.   I accept that. I mean we are animals after all, there is no guarantee of living a happy life or even a mediocre life. I guess I was stupid enough to somehow believe this hollywood good ending story shit growing up, or that really bad stuff can somehow don't affect me.. maybe a positive optimism but in my case it was delusional. I never worked on myself after it was all too late, I never got any help, I always repressed everything, I was always too scared to to anything about my problems which were well-known to me at a younger age already, however I just repressed and repressed and hoped everything would magically get better in some way.. or maybe I didn't hope it would get better and actually just didnt give a shit and with my passive agression against myself, I was constantly sabotaging myself to the point where I am at now. I hated myself deep down even when I was a kid. I feel like I deserve this shitty life after all.  I guess at the same time, weirdly enough, I felt entitled to having a good or at least average life, because growing up I never had to work in school to pass exams and even in university I never had to really work much to pass my exams. I am disgusted by my own entitledness to be honest. I am a twisted person. I don't even understand myself fully.. but I know I am a coward. Some people from poorer countries would love to trade places with me, I have a healthy body, in a technologically advanced country, I am reasonably intelligent, I speak 5 languages.    But all of that doesn't matter when you are dead inside and dread living every day.. have nothing to look forward to and just want to be dead. I am thinking about blasting steroids before I take my life but I dont know.  If someone could get into my exact situation, it would take them maybe a year and they would have a decent apartment, a driver's license and all the things I never had because I never managed to accomplish them. I was never assertive, I guess I suffer from learned helplessness and feelings of powerlessness. That's why I am in the situation I am in today.   I guess that's it.. maybe someone younger than myself can learn from this stupid rant and try to get help while it's still possible.   "	sw

I feel flattered, but I feel bad that he worked up the courage, and it amounted to nothing. He was pretty young too, maybe four or five years younger than me. I still have the number, and I'm thinking of texting him because it might be rude not to? But maybe better to just let it lie. What do you think?"	cc
Don't know what to do with it Been thinking about suicide for more than three years...feeling miserable and depressed most of the time...I definitely think this life is meant to be depressing and full of sadness that I even feel sorry for normal people although I'm in an extremely worse situation (which shows how terrible my mental state is)....just fucking worthless needing a painless method to ctb...what a depressing world we live in really!	sw

"Im not sure what Im doing with my life? I just moved out of a real bad series of situations lasting around 3 or so years.  I guess you could say that my early 20s, rather than reaching my peak, were like falling down a flight of stairs. -- I'd really like to be able to date or something, but I just can't really socialize and don't really think I'll ever fall in love again. It would be something if I had a serious passion, but all I have time for is working and sleeping.  Tell me, casualconversation, what would you do if you were about to turn 26 and didnt really have anything to live for?  Im not depressed yet, but Im here because I started looking at pictures of my ex from 4 years ago.

"I just can't cope anymore. I live with a lot of illnesses. EDS3 (which causes almost daily dislocations and unending pain), POTS, seizures, sacroiliitis (which causes intractable pain in my hips), migraines, a bulging disc in my spine, I could go on for hours. It's so hard to keep fighting and I just can't do it anymore. I have no family bar my dad in Scotland (I live in London and we don't get to see each other more than once a year) and it's so hard to keep going. I've lost almost everything to these diseases. My dream career, my university degree, my job. My friends (who never call because god forbid they be near a sick person despite being paramedics). I cut off my nmother four years ago on the 9th of this month. I don't regret doing that but it's left me alone. Now I'm housebound and can barely get around the house. I haven't been able to leave the house myself since July 15th last year. It's soul destroying.    I've been feeling low for several weeks and told my SO about it. Thing is, it'll take at least six months for a referral to psych (thank you NHS...) and I don't think I have that long. Not to mention that we're about to move into a new city and it'll take a while to sort out doctors as I'm under about 10 different specialties right now. Urology, gastroenterology, two different rheumatologists (soon to be a third), two neurologists, a urologist, gynaecology, orthopaedics, all sorts. I can't cope and I know I need help asap.   Yesterday I spent most of the day crying my eyes out and wanting to die. Today I don't feel like that but I've been looking up the fatality of various medications if I were to take them. Right now I Don't particularly want to die, but I don't want to live either. I just feel numb.   I don't know how to get help and I don't know what to do but I'm scared I'm going to do myself harm. I just don't know what to do. I don't feel like I'll ever get well enough again to be able to leave the house on my own, that I'll never get back to work or get a degree (which is something I'm desperate to do). I have my SO but that's all I have. I'm just scared. I don't want to keep fighting and face surgeries and pain.   I don't want to be here any more. "	sw

"How do you feel about handing toddlers iPads, smartphones, or any other kind of smart devices to keep them entertained? You've seen them, children between 3-8 with tablets that barely fit in their small hands playing games/watching children's content.  On one hand it's 2018 and the way we live our lives by choosing what to do with our time will get influenced by what technology we have available. Of course this is true for both adults and children. What's wrong with kids watching barney on their parents' phones during a long road trip? Not to mention that should they wish, they can use that phone to learn new things on the fly. An exciting new frontier for education.  On the other hand, children at that age are rapidly developing their cognitive function so by ""spoiling"" them of content, parents are irresponsibly depriving them of unique experiences that brings with it a unique lesson that's invaluable to their character. This is different from Television in that now you can potentially be on a device every waking moment of your childhood.  I'm in the latter camp personally, I've never liked seeing kids with screens in their hands all the time. Although obviously there's merit in the words ""everything in moderation."""	cc

I am normally good with sticking to these types of things, and the nutrition isn't even that terrible/strict to be honest.

I'm friends with a lot of people in the military, and of course I know these people get transferred a lot.  I'm out of the country for a couple of months and I was hoping to see my whole group of friends reunited.   Turns out my first friend from that group (also the guy I fancy) it's being transferred way before time and someone broke the news to me just yesterday. Also another friend with his wife (whom is a good friend as well) might get transferred before time too.  They are very special people in my life and makes me a bit blue to see them go like this.  Edit; I just realised one of those friends had a minor accident on a plane on Monday (he's Air Force) and the next day on our whatsapp group he said: ""I love you all very much"".

"Want to die but too afraid I'll survive an attempt I feel really pathetic for being suicidal about this stuff because so many other people have bigger, worse struggles going on in their lives but I thought I'd post here anyways because I really am at my wit's end and I just want to be gone forever.  I feel completely hopeless. I'm going through a really messy breakup with the girl who I was convinced I was going to marry. Also in the coming month there's a possibility of me getting into some legal trouble, someone is falsely accusing me of something and I'm afraid that they will get me into some sort of trouble. I can't seem to catch a break; everything in my life goes downhill just as it starts looking up again. Every person who has ever made me genuinely happy has left me. I miss my ex so much and right now it's looking like so there's little to no chance of her ever coming back.  I do see a therapist but that's not really helping me. My depression has gotten to the point where I don't even have the energy to fake happiness anymore. I just want a fucking break from all this pain. My thoughts grow more and more suicidal as every day goes by. I want to kill myself and I'm not afraid of death itself, I'm afraid that I'll survive an attempt and have to live with paralysis or severe brain damage or some other injury. I don't know what to do anymore. I just want to be gone forever but I'm so afraid that I'll survive. I feel stuck."	sw

"Nothing much to live for it seems So my wife (only of four years) cheated on me two days before Valentine’s Day 2018. At first I really wanted to just separate, but her attempts to reconcile made me want to stick it out. Well soon after she is suddenly not fighting for me, and is dating the s.o.b. We all three went to high school together, but it’s not like we were good friends or anything. Small town everyone knows everyone ya know? So the guy is married and has two kids, and she and I have one 2 year old son. She goes out every weekend with the guy to spend the night at a hotel. She doesn’t work and hasn’t worked in years, and I pay all the bills. I wasn’t the best in the relationship, but I wasn’t bad by any means. I never cheated or anything I just wasn’t as romantic as I needed to be. There are reasons for that, but let’s move on. So it’s been close to three months now or so and they have been fighting ALOT lately. She’s starting to see that the guy isn’t as perfect as she thought. Every time they fight and she sees him she acts and says stuff like she thinks they are going to break up. Well every time she comes home the next day it’s the same shit. They are still fighting, and she feels like she needs to dump him, but it never happens. I feel like I’ve put myself in such a low dark place y’all. How lame am I to sit here and wait on the sidelines to scoop her up once they split up. I feel so second choice, like garbage even a cat wouldn’t go through. I don’t have absolutely any friends and haven’t in years. My family and I aren’t close by any means. I’m outside right now and I feel like it’s getting to be the time for me to go ahead and end my life. I feel like it would be a good thing to do it while she is away so I’m not bothered. There’s just so much I want to say but my brain hurts from everything I don’t even know how to express what I’m feeling. I would do anything for this woman, and I’m just so lost. I don’t understand. I don’t have Facebook, or any other social media, so this will be my possible last post on the internet indefinitely. Thank you whoever you are for stumbling across this and listening to a broken soul.  So here’s an update. I just had to watch her get all prettied up, just to see her get into the guys truck just now. Now it’s just me and my two year old son. This is like the tenth time I had to watch this play out. Before she left she kissed my cheek gave me a hug and told me she loves me like she does every time. I’m so confused. I feel like I’m being played. I hate everything in the world.   Update #2 Like fifteen minutes after posting the first update I decided to load my son in the car and get some pods for my Juul to calm my nerves. Halfway there.... boom! Tire blows out. Alright no big deal, my life already sucks ass, but at least with this I have a spare. Nope the spare is flat. Now me and my son are stranded on the road at 1am. I hate my life"	sw

"I obsessively segment, reverse and visualize words in my head. I also count the amount of letters in the words. I am constantly taking words I hear or see throughout the day and breaking them into pieces in my head.  For instance, the word ""hospital"" would become hos-pi-tal to keep an even amount of letters on each side of a pivotal couple of letters in the middle.  It could also become hosp-ital but that's less satisfying.  If it's a word with an odd number of letters I'll only put one letter in the middle, such as chev-r-olet.    Not as commonly, I'll reverse words and pronounce them backwards, also in my head.  I also count the letters in the words I'm visualizing.  So if someone were to ask me how many letters are in the word ""conversation"", I would be able to instantly answer 12 without having to think, because I've ran most of the common words through my head dozens if not hundreds of times.  I also take the first letter or two of two words and swap them, so saying ""I'm going to take a shower"" turns into ""I'm going to shake a tower.""    I'm a fully functioning adult with a great career so this doesn't impact me financially in any way, but it does on occasion cause me to ""get lost"" in the word manipulation and I stop listening to people.  Normally I can do all of this and still listen, but some of the tougher, longer words cause me to really get quite in-depth.  I'm not aggressively seeking answers to what this is, I've always just attributed it to me being weird, but if someone has insight as to what it might be, I'd love to discuss it.  I'd also like to discuss similar habits others might have.  I don't have a lot of cont-ig-uous time to reply, but I'll be on and off of Reddit the rest of the afternoon!"	cc

Basically, I want to keep going and he doesn’t. We still have a month and we’re not breaking up until then. However, I’m going through my own breakup emotions right now, so I’ve turned to the one thing that never lets me down: music.  I’m not asking for advice on my relationship, but instead I wanna know what songs empower you or pump you up! I’ve been looking for songs that are about getting over men, but I’d love to hear about your songs that just make you feel better, that you use to workout, that you listen to before playing in a game or performing, whatever!   As an example, my usual pump-up song is N*ggas in Paris by Kanyé and Jay-Z, but currently I have Sorry Not Sorry by Demi Levato on repeat. "	cc

It was a great time, made some snacks took her out to shop and got her dinner. There was the whole, ""did you find a new girl yet?"" And all that. But for some reason that annoyed me more than it should she referred to my running pants as sweat pants.  I don't know if its because I like words and their various definitions, but sweats to me are for cold days and lazing about.

The thief ran off when someone saw him and he threw a bunch of the stuff he was carrying (including the wallet that was in my dash). Thankfully it was just an old wallet I had stopped using full of useless business cards.   After work Wednesday I had bought a huge bag of Swedish fish. I was confused when I left for class Thursday morning because my Swedish fish were gone out of the front seat. I thought that I must’ve misplaced them somehow or maybe my boyfriend took them as a joke. Apparently the thief was hungry enough to steal an opened bag of Swedish fish! "	cc
"I just want to venti Almost a year ago I tried to kill myself. I took 26 vicodins and washed them down with some vodka, took three tabs of lsd because I had them on hand and thought ‘fuck it I’m gonna die anyway why not.’ I locked myself in my bathroom and when I started feeling the effects, went to my family room and gave my sister a hug. Following that I fell asleep. I have no idea why I didn’t stop breathing in my sleep, but I woke up hours later and I thought that I failed. I knew I would have severe liver damage if I lived, so I had my mom take me to the hospital where I stayed until I was put into a psych ward for kids who have severe depression. After being put on meds, I was doing better until school started up (I’m still in high school) Since the meds stopped working or whatever, I’ve started cutting a bit, and am having fairly common suicidal thoughts again. I’ve also stated using drugs and alcohol again.   Thanks for reading this if you got all the way through and I really just wanted to put this all out since I have t talked about my attempt since it happened. "	sw
"Drained, Sucked, Exhausted: Goodbye I hate my father.  I actually hate my father. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells when I'm around him. Y'know the close intimacy that can only be achieved after years of inhibition and openness? A closeness that you can only attain with the people who raised you?   Yeah, I have a more meaningful connection with the Chinese delivery guy who yells at me for tipping too little.  Being around my father is exhausting. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells or disarming a nuclear power plant.  Small, insignificant things get under his skin. For example, when I was using my phone at the beginning of a move, he screamed, ""SHUT THE HELL UP!"" (this coming from a man who used his laptop all throughout a movie that I begged him not to and had selected after skimming for 2+ hours to find something family oriented and free) And then he proceeded to berate me and call me ""a nightmare.""  For all my faults I'm the farthest thing from a nightmare. As a teenager, I stayed away from sex, drugs, and social media like the plague. I got into good school and managed to snag some scholarships. But of course, they're worthless, seeing as I was rejected from the top tier schools he made me apply to. I'm majoring in comp sci, and he insists on that I switch to ""Computer and Electrical Engineering,"" because of prestige. I lost 70 lbs and he still points out my weight, like I sit on my ass and eat Cheetos 24/7.  In order to make him like me, I don this fake persona. I enjoy Star Wars, plan vacations in Europe, major in STEM. Meanwhile, in my hamster hole, I harbor vivid fantasies of beating the shit out of the man.  I feel so exhausted when I'm around him and it shows. I'm so tired of looking for reasons to stay alive when my dad can just shatter them in seconds. I want to stop living. I feel like a wind-up toy with a broken key. I feel trapped, I'm sorry  I can't  I can't  I'm sorry, I feel so trapped here. I'm trying to reach out and yet I feel so alienated, it's like someone else is typing on the keyboard and I'm just peering in. Please, I need someone to see this, please, anybody, I know I'm not trying to be an attention whore, but please, anybody, please. "	sw

"I've finally let go of a long-time bad habit! I don't think I've cut my finger nails with a nail cutter in the past 10 years, used to either bite or break my finger nails off. Nail-biting was something I often did while studying or watching sports, and yes I was quite embarrassed about it.   However, for the past few months, I've kept my hands occupied with stress balls, and with dedication I've finally let go of the habit! My nails have naturally grown well, and my fingers finally look pleasant! "	cc
"Am I worth it? Hello everybody (: . I am a high school student. Currently I'm 18 years old. I started to be religious at the age of 15 (an abrahamic religion- all abrahamic religions have 89.9% of the same rules). I decided to be religious cause it requires me to be positive- and I was negative every day of my adolescence life, until I decided to add faith in my life. But for my more positive attitude I had to sacrifice my romantic/sexual life: I couldn't talk to women in a certain way, I couldn't touch women in public etc. In my first days of high school at the age of 15 I denied to a 19 year-old female to be my girlfriend, and later two 16 year-olds. I told this to two of my buddies and they called me queer (as in gay). I stopped talking to these folks immediately and wish them no good. Now I understand that I am only an object to other people because I am practicing religion. I stopped having contact with almost everyone except my homosexual classmate- since we now had common label ""QUEER LOSER"". I never hung out with other religious abrahamists because they tend to radicalize everything and they are dangerious- I cloud live with the bad reputation I had as a ""QUEER LOSER"" but not a ""EXTREMIST"" tag cause that is not my intention I am a nursing school student and I want to save lives. I do my homework and I was proud of myself until now when I realized that I have thrown every teenagers dream in the bin. I feel like a loser and that I am odd. I am embarrassed of myself and recently I had to alter myself mentally. I wanted to be tough to protect myself. I started to watch prison documentaries and act the part. I also started to exercise more since my bullies used my weakness to ridicule me. I practiced talking like famous american criminals to scare people. I have built my reputation up and now they don't bully me cause otherwise they will have to face me with some good consequences. I have abandoned religion but I have no friends. I am always angry towards women and I can't control it. I don't want to be angry towards them. Also my school has abuse staff members all teachers are behaving as they want calling students stupid and making fun of them. One 17 year old girl attempted suicide. She had the luck that she didn't have any consequences from that  dangerous attempt.  ***I feel that I don't deserve to live because I denied romantic/sexual relationships with these females. I mean I am like so insane for doing that, am I not. I feel like I'm not accepted by society I feel buried. Everybody hates me because of that and thinks I'm stupid. I'm a fool. Do I deserve to exist? What do you think? (I feel like one a guy who gives away his golden castle to spend his time meditating in the mountains- so stupid why did you throw away all your good stuff?)"	sw
"My life doesn’t feel like it’s going anywhere I was sexually assaulted and I don’t know how to deal with it. I’m a senior in hs and i haven’t heard back from the program I really want. All my friends are moving forward and making uni plans and I feel like I’m getting left behind. My marks are dropping, I’m soooo depressed I don’t wanna get out of bed, and it feels like no one sees me suffering. I barely see my mom anymore( she leaves before I wake up) and my sister’s never home. Everyone around me is walking past me and I don’t know how to reach out to them. I just feel like a giant burden that brings people down if I don’t act like I’m okay but if I act like I’m okay it hurts more. "	sw
"Dealing with suicide in the Army I feel like I'm just wasting so much time. I do nothing all day. My daily routine involves:  wake up go to PT go back to my room report to my sergeant I'm told to stay out of sight and out of mind go back to my room  and repeat.  I joined the army for experience, and I don't need all the other benefits so my time here has been completely wasted. On top of that, a few things happened in my personal life that I cannot control so I just feel so stuck every day, unable to do anything about it. I feel like if I stay here one more week, I'm going to finally kill myself.  I've told my sergeant and my command about it, I self referred myself to a consular and have been seeing him for the past month or so. I've reached out to close friends back home, I've reached out to my family but nothing seems to work. I've done everything that I could ever think of to help me through this but I come much closer to just accepting suicide each day. Yesterday I even bought a knife just so I had the ability to just end it at any time now. I have a plan and I just know I'll eventually follow through with it.  I dont know what else to do and I don't want to live with this pain much longer.   "	sw
"Missed myself again last night. I left my closet because I was in pain. I went upstairs to hug my little sister, seeing her usually gives me a reason to stay and guilt over what I want to do.   This time, I felt nothing even while holding the child. I think I'm disconnecting.   Not sure how much longer I'll stay, guys. I used to tell myself to graduate university first so I accomplish one visible thing at least in my life... but now I don't know.  I just feel physically and mentally numb."	sw

"Those little things Depression is a pain in the ass. I let one little thing get to me and then it just spirals from there. I hate myself for letting something so small to just irritate me and then I find myself feeling pathetic and useless. All the suicidal thoughts come back and it won’t stop. In my head I’m just to kill myself for being so pathetic and useless. In a burden on my family that I can’t bring myself to ask for their help. I want to die. I want to die because I’m afraid to keep living this way. I’m so tired. Why? Why do I have to keep struggling like this? There’s nothing I want to live for and there’s no desire to keep going. I’m tired of feeling like this. Last time, my plan failed and felt like shit afterwards. Thought maybe it’s a sign to keep trying whatever I can but it certainly doesn’t feel like that now. Why do I have to keep trying when I want to die so bad? For now they’re just thoughts but how long will that last before those little things pile up and become too heavy to bear anymore. I have to make a better plan for when that time comes. I’m alone and scared right now and I don’t know what to do..."	sw
"I just feel depressed and lost There are days in my life where i just feel useless and lately i've felt like my life isn't real and i don't know why i feel this. I've tried to cope with drugs and just this year i was smoking about half a pound of weed a month. I thought that it would help but it didn't. I don't really know what to type here but my life feels meaningless. I have attempted suicide twice now, with my second attempt landing me in the hospital again and then ended up in a mental hospital just a few days from my birthday.The odd thing was that i actually enjoyed myself there during my last day. I had cuts on my wrist and i had to wear bandages for a few weeks until the cuts healed and all throughout those weeks people at school would ask me what they were for and obviously they knew but i never said anything. I just started community college again after failing misriably at my old college which was up in northern california, I just recently moved back home from there after certain situations forcing me to move there for a time, and Im sorry for all the rambling i just don't know what to write about since i just feel so depressed and anxious lately.

"I used to be afraid That thinking about what would happen if I kill myself. The permanent presence of darkness and the things I would never see or experience anymore.   Hell, half of me imagines waking up in the hospital. Would things change then if that happened? Clearly not. Well, things would have changed 'cause it means I failed killing myself and in turn a permanent damage on myself.   But now? I'm not afraid. I feel happy actually. I'll do it April 10, Tuesday. 3 AM.  Already talked to my best friend. Said my goodbye, she suspects I was gonna cut her off again. That's good, but it's sad since she said sorry she doesn't open up to me but might say it someday... I won't be there anymore.   I've thought of stabbing myself in the guts. So I really won't have reasons to survive.   Why I'm doing this? Since I've got such a perfect life? I don't know. Maybe I'm self-destructive. Maybe I can no longer live with my anxiety. Maybe I can no longer live feeling nothing. Maybe I've lose the purpose of who I am. Maybe because i've ruined my friendship with my best friend. Maybe i'm done being a burden to my parents.   Maybe.   Only problem is, it would have been nice though. To see what would happened after I died. I'll make a post again, but for mow i'm gonna make the most of my Sunday and Monday. "	sw
"Envy I broke up with my girlfriend of 7 years... sort of... I wanted her to talk to me, all she did was work and sleep. Sex had stopped years ago, going out stopped, we stopped hanging out or even doing things together months ago. The same day we broke up she started dating a guy who was physically and emotionally abusive to her (former ""friend"" I kicked out of our life). She admitted to having sex and a relationship with him days after. They have literally been doing everything I told her I wanted us to do... I'm physically ill and when I tried to talk to her about the fact that he was physically violent with her she told me I needed to ""let her go"" and that ""she didn't care about her friends or their opinions"". It's been almost 2 weeks since then and I've been thinking a lot about how I envy those who can just let go of... life. It sounds terrible but I'm far too scared to do anything but I can't imagine moving on with my life. I feel more stuck than before and terrified of the future. I'm also being forced to move into a new city with no connections or friends... feeling very isolated and scared. I'm sorry if this is not the correct place for this but I don't know what to do, just felt a need to be heard. I'm sorry."	sw
"I never ask for attention but now I really wish I was getting more of it I decided to chase a pipe-dream yesterday on behalf of my step dad with stage 4 lung cancer. He’s incredibly sick (been in the hospital all week) and his health has been declining for months. Someone very nicely donated their tickets for day 1 of the Masters on Thursday, which is one of his all time dreams to attend. The other is meeting Tiger Woods. I’ve posted on Facebook (around 100 shares), tweeted an insane amount of people, contacted news stations, etc but I feel like I’m getting nowhere.   I feel so helpless in everyday situations because there’s not much I can do to help with the progression of the disease. But meeting his idol is something I know could happen with the right amount of attention from the right people.   There’s nothing I want to see more than this incredible man’s dream brought to life.   Anyway, thanks for reading. It’s just been a terrible week and everyone here is always so nice to me "	cc
I’ve come to peace with my decision. I used to cry all of the time because I wanted to die. I used to feel so sad that I couldn’t shake the feeling of wanting to end my life. But after some serious thought I am for certain that this is my way out. I have never been so certain of anything in my life honestly. I don’t know what day I’ll do it. I know it’ll be within the next week. I just have to find out how and where I want to do it. I’m oddly excited to see the end. I’m excited for this to be over. Life never treated me too well. 	sw
"Radio songs (#91) ^^^^I ^^^^made ^^^^my ^^^^circle ^^^^of ^^^^trust, ^^^^but ^^^^can ^^^^y'all ^^^^be ^^^^trusted?  I am not a huge fan of the music that's played on the radio in my area. We have one classic rock station that plays the same songs every day, an ""alternative"" station that does the same thing, and several pop stations that play the same songs every hour. I'm sure there are some others but all I know is I don't get to hear music I'm really a fan of on the radio. I currently have a few different songs stuck in my head that I heard on repeat today from the radio.  When I go to workout or chill at my head coach's office at the fitness center in my college, one of the pop stations is always playing. If I'm at the gym for longer than an hour I realize that I'll hear the same songs get played that were on earlier. I try to tune them out but it's playing so loudly that I can't always do that.   One thing that bothered me a year ago when I was working out was this: I did upperbody workouts around the same time every Thursday morning. Somehow, whether I got there earlier or later than usual or changed up my order of machines I used, it seemed that every week as soon as I got on the chest press machine Chained To The Rhythm by Katy Perry started playing. I don't like Katy Perry's music. In the entire semester I think only once this did not happen and I so so appreciated Justin Timberlake for bringing Sexy Back so I could go a workout without the Katy Perry song. I could workout with my own music, but I just see that as too much of a hassle, even with wireless headphones. I don't need music to motivate me either when working out.  I know a lot of people enjoy Spotify or Pandora, but I don't use them because I know the musicians I like would lose out on money from those radio apps. The sound engineer at my theater said one of his buddies had over 100,000 plays on a song on Spotify and didn't even get $2 from that. I much rather buy a CD (either physical or digital, but preferably physical) and upload it onto my iTunes playlist to put on my iPod.   When I first got my old iPod touch I had a metal radio station I downloaded that I enjoyed but I eventually deleted it. I did find a bunch of new bands (to me) through that app though.   I hope whenever I get a car it is recent enough that it'll have an aux cord for my iPod, but old enough that it has an actual CD player since I own a good amount of physical CDs.  Do you have any good radio stations by you?  When was the last time you bought an actual CD?  How do you feel about ""radio edit"" versions of songs?  Do you use music to motivate you when doing specific activities?  What are your thoughts on Spotify and other radio apps?

"i give up This is what i wrote a month ago to a friend:  have you ever been crushed? i mean that in every sense of the word, having every last dream be taken away from you. some because of your sheer fucking incompentence and some because this is how life is? absolutely fucking nothing you do going well. your entire life being a trail of failuire with not even the slightest shadow of success. feeling like a worthless piece of shit living for no reason, writing shit in a journal or notepad or whatever the fuck just to not bother others with your senseless bullshit that noone cares about or can understand. not truthly caring about a single person because every time you do they get taken away. waking up for no reason only to repeat the same shit you did 100 days ago, the monotony of it all eating away at you and yet you somehow find a beacon of hope, a new dream. and then you fuck that up too so badly you don't even know if you should get out of bed because what's the fucking point anyway. staring blankly at something every 5 minutes because now only your own toughts can entertain you but everything you think about is depressing. wasting all your talents because of course you do, why wouldn't that happend. knowing that next morning when you wake up all you're going to think about is how fucking long is this thing gonna take to kill me and how much will i suffer before then and is it worth it cutting things short. depression is at the 9th ring of hell and it's going down with humanity. now i have to ask myself... is it even worth pressing enter  now i just said fuck it and i'm going to go with my plan. once i get to 18 years old i'll write a testament that gives all my assets (a 45k euro apartment) to a girl i love that completely ignores me. why her? i don't know, nor do i care anymore, it's the same thing giving it to anyone else. anyway, after that comes the sharpest knife i can find, subclavial artery, unconsciousness in 20 seconds, death in less than 50. you can leave comments and opinions but leave the ""light at the end of the tunnel"" bullshit out, it really doesn`t do anything other than to clog up the comments"	sw

"Is not ""caring"" so much about most things really a bad thing? Alright so this has occurred 3 times now with 3 different girls (who are just good friends) where when having a conversation about whatever with them they always say something along the lines: ""well, what do you care about"" or ""when do you ever care.""  It's not that I'm not ever interested in what they're saying, I just seem to have a more relaxed opinion on almost everything for the most part. Things that would typically bother  the average person, doesn't really bother me  and most of my responses are never anything negative. I usually try and be optimistic as much as possible. But this way of thinking seems to come off as me ""not ever caring about anything"". This isn't my intention at all, I just try and not let little  things get to me. I don't see a reason to sweat  over the small stuff. But ultimately, this mentality has led people into thinking I don't care about anything which is just not true. Just because something doesn't upset or bother me, doesn't mean I don't care. I guess I just need a new way to express my thoughts, opinions, and feelings. Who knows. "	cc
"""You don't look depressed"" ""you don't look depressed"", ""you don't have ADHD or depression stop making this up for attention"", ""stop faking it"", ""You don't have the right to be depressed"", ""You attention whore"".

It just hurts more, everybody expects others to help out. My friends tell me to go to my family, my family tells me to get over it, I feel so damn hurt it's like fucking hell. We're only in 7th grade for fucks sake. And people now expect me to be a psychopath for being depressed. Saying that I may also have BPD makes them even more unaccepting of me, and it really hurts. I can't handle this anymore, the people who accept me for who I am I don't have the courage to talk to about and don't feel like I belong with anyone anymore, the ones I trusted just ditch me, my family tells me to get over it. It hurts I just want to die, what's worse than being depressed since 8 and attempting suicide at 9? Being treated like dog shit for admitting it trying to get support, only to get even more lonelier. Now I just realized the people who accept me for who I am but telling those who I trusted how I felt and getting ignored all the time makes my trust issues even worse. I know some care, but I don't have the courage, I'm too weak for this world, I can't handle telling my own mom the truth. I feel like a big fat liar who is never trust-worthy. Putting my trust into the people I thought were right for me was a huge mistake, now I only have 4 months till school ends to tell the ones who truly like me."	sw
"Moo can speak english and has a better short term memory than I do. So this literally just fucking happened and I have no one to tell it to in person or on the phone at the moment but I needed to tell the story before I overthink it.   About fifteen minutes ago, my roommate's cat is meowing at me because he hates it when we feed him regular hard cat food and that's all we had for him for the night. I jokingly told Moo the cat, as he's meowing at me in a very disrespectful tone, that I would go buy him his favorite wet food if he found me enough money to go buy beer as well. He stopped meowing, jumped on to my cluttered nightstand, knocked over a couple books and some papers, then jumped back onto my bed and kept yelling at me in catspeak. While telling him that he was an asshole, I gathered up my books and random papers and began to put them back in their properly disorganized place, but stopped and dropped it all back to the ground. On my nightstand, underneath all those months of clutter, was, I shit you fucking not, a twenty fucking dollar bill. Moo got his favorite cat food tonight."	cc

While many circles grew large with an open key, we stayed strong until some genuinely good person betrayed us. We became an actual community of people. I only invited those who created positive circles that were wholesome and made the world better. lots of people in the Circle of Good Deeds donated to charity, others challenged people to send them drawings. Regardless, it was a group of people who weren't just looking to get the highest number on their flair, but rather to use r/CircleofTrust to make the world a better place.

But one day, one damn day, you’re gonna look back and think, wow, times sucked back then, but I got through them. I’m happy with my family of four and I’m happy with my beautiful wife. The Godfather of my children is my best friend and they always ask to see him and we always do. We wake up every Sunday morning to eat pancakes and head to Church. I work at a job that helps take care of my children and wife, plus I make enough to hand over some money to my mom and dad. I’m happy with my life and don’t wish any bad upon myself or wish to die anymore.  At least, I wish that’s how my life could’ve been. "	sw

"My dreams, the things that kept me sane, are now gone. I don't know if I want to kill myself.   In a rush of emotions, I'd want to. But when I take it in, the closing distances with suicide, I falter.  17 years old; a lifetime of wanting to study in a prestigious US university.  Why?  I hate the Philippines, I love the West, I hate being poor, I want avenues to wealth. Most especially, I think I despise my family  Countless hours to study for the SAT. Sleepless nights to get a respectable mark in school. Methodical and draining hours, days, months to prove that I have extra-curricular. Yet I'm an average student.  Do I think I'll get into UCLA, the school of my dreams? A resounding NO.  However, I can't do this anymore. I have no one to support me and my dreams but myself. And to finally face and accept the gloomy environment I'm in, it's heart breaking. It breaks my heart that 'family' is just a word.   It's a blot on the dictionary, a pixel on the internet, and a wave from the mouth.  My family doesn't support me and my dreams.  My sister diminishes the existence of my depression. My mom's dead. My dad? My dad just wants for his own gain.  Like I've said. I don't think I'll even get considered for UCLA. But it hurts that I'm still managing to fall.  This isn't suppose to be edgy, and may seem like a minor nuisance in one's life. But my dreams. The only thing I wanted. I never asked for expensive clothing or gadgets. I never asked for a car. I never asked for those things.  I just wanted a way out. Away from my dysfunctional family and a shell of myself. To start anew.  Tomorrow I might say I love my dad and my sister, because I don't want to jinx their deaths. I don't want them dead. I just want to be the person I want to be; that includes their distance.  Then again I might regret that.  But I digress, I don't mind if you think my problem is petty. Just know these are my dreams.  And even if I kill myself. I'm already dead."	sw

"Am I in trouble? So today was my friends birthday and he invited like six people over for a small celebration. We had a blast and set up his new Nintendo switch and played some Mario kart and ate pizza. It's a chill night.  Well we end up squishing four people on one couch and two on a love chair. I end up sitting next to the hosts best friend and we start hitting it off. I soon have my arm around her and she is leaning into me. Now the host leaves to go drop people off because they weren't sober and could not drive themselves. That left the hosts best friend and me alone in the house. He got back and we were basically acting like a bad couple to third wheel with. After ACCIDENTALLY ignoring the host for a while, he said I'm glad you two are getting along.

"If I tell someone I feel like killing myself soon, am I guilt-tripping them? The person (let's call them Alex) I'm going to tell hasn't known me very long. I've only really gotten to known Alex for just a few months, but I feel like I should tell them. I do however, feel betrayed by them because they never want hang out with me in public or put up a real conversation when there's people around. I don't trust anyone, and so I feel like I've been betrayed by them, or hurt I guess. (although, I feel this way with all my friends.) The main reason why I'm conflicted as to whether I should tell Alex or not, is that I don't want them to feel sorry for me. I don't want them to think that they're the reason, or that they should stay by my side because I'm telling them that I'm suicidal. I really don't want anyone to become or stay as my friend out of guilt or because of my condition. I've told people, but they've never taken me seriously. Regarding Alex, they have told me about something that has bothered them for a while, and I don't know if they only told me just because they don't really know me, and/or because they know I won't tell anyone. I don't know, I guess I do want help from them, but I don't want them to feel any worse than they already do.    ___ So for my question again, should I still tell them?"	sw

"I’M LYING TO EVERYONE I have been struggling with depression for the last six years. My depression ended my marriage and makes it difficult to maintain friendships. I’m, yet again, taking an SSRI. It’s strange; I feel as though the antidepressants make me tolerable to be around-for family and coworkers-but I don’t think I’m any less depressed. I think about suicide every single day. I have a plan. I’ve been asked about suicidal ideation, by my primary healthcare provider, by my partner, my boss. I always deny wanting to end my life because I know what such an admission would yield. I worked as a behavioral health RN; I know how inadequate the mental health system is and an involuntary admission to a local psych unit isn’t going to help me any.    I’ve tried making positive life changes. I left my job as a registered nurse to work in a more creative field. I quit drinking alcohol-March 25 marked a year sober. I took up yoga. I left the city and relocated to a quiet suburb. I got a dog and started tending plants. None of it matters.  I feel so hopeless, like there’s nothing to look forward to.

He told me not to tell anybody but obviously his safety is most important. I have absolutely no clue how to handle this situation and any advice is appreciated. I was thinking of offering to pay for some therapy sessions and talking him into it or something because I assume the last thing he wants to do is spend his own money on something he believes won’t help. I’m really lost and I know this is a very fragile situation and what I do means life or death with him so please advise me how to handle this. Also if anyone is going to suggest telling his parents, I don’t think that would work because as soon as he realizes they know and I told them he will realize the only person he thought he could trust has betrayed him and that would probably be the final nail in his coffin (plus he blames his parents in the first way for how he feels)."	sw

I'm not saying that you should ignore real problems and all that, but it seems as though finding anything positive is just a sign of pure stupidity and ignorance. I *actually* ran into a comment one day that said ""Hope for the best, expect the worse"". Some replies even encouraged this mindset.   What's funny is that I actually took a month-long break from Reddit just to move away from this for awhile. Coming back, I actually thought people took a chill pill since I've left. It seems as though everyone's going back. Even r/jokes and r/showerthoughts have popular posts revolving around this kind of mindset. Guess I was wrong about my hopes.

"I have nothing left. This post is my last attempt. My parents abused me, so I wanted to get away from them. They made me lie about being severely mentally ill (I had depression and anxiety, but they made me exaggerate it a lot and made me say things to the psychiatrist to appear extra sick) to get into a ""mental illness support home"". The other people living there made my life as hellish as my home situation. I was then moved to another mental illness support home out in the countryside, so now I can't go to school, all my friends drifted away from me until only my boyfriend was left- and he broke up with me today.  To elaborate,  I have no contact with my family since they abused me. I have to keep pretending I can't do things by myself so the home staff don't kick me out on the street. I don't have a school to go to. My computer broke, so I'm stuck in my room all day doing absolutely nothing. It has been this way for 1 year. The depression isn't getting better- I did the whole ""cut all sugar and wheat flour from diet eat all greens and exercise"" crap. I bought therapy books on dialectical behavior therapy. I did the mindfulness bullshit daily for half the year. It Doesn't fucking matter. The other people living here can't even hold a normal conversation, and I'm honestly afraid of them knowing the tantrums they keep throwing and how they tried to break into my room. I don't have any friends left. My boyfriend broke up with me.

Some people go on and on, either no one else notices the warning signs or if they do, they either don't say anything and those who did get pushed away, which is what I kept doing. Even though I've always felt like my whole family and everyone I've known knows I have nothing to offer, that I'm a huge dumb ass and just overall a huge joke.

I'm too embarrassed to contact any of them again because then we would have to talk about how we are and what we've been doing. They would say they are at university and have partners or whatever and the only honest answer I could give about myself is that I kept dropping out of school and I constantly think about killing myself.

"Lazy Wednesday Happy Humpday to all you Reddit peeps. I’m enjoying a lazy Wednesday afternoon. After class I met some friends at Loro, the new collaboration between Aaron Franklin and Tyson Cole in Austin off South Lamar. [The food](http://imgur.com/a/klvV2) and drinks were amaze balls. I got to sample the Crunchy Sweet Corn Fritters, Smoked Prime Bavette, Garlic Rice Noodles, and Pork Shoulder. The Old Fashioned was also really good and paired nicely with the pork shoulder. Definitely recommend to everybody in Austin or visiting. How’s everyone else’s Wednesday going? "	cc
"Woop Woop I don't sleep anymore and I barely eat. My parents noticed and are now kind of worried. Mostly mad though. That's a change. I had a slight burst of energy. I think it's my body's last ""hurrah"" before I fall into the sweet release of death. That was a joke, I'm not dying at least not on the outside. (woah super edgy) I've commented on a few threads to try and at least have someone to talk to. I'm lonely."	sw
"I'm doing it after the Stanley cup playoffs I'm just curious as to who will win,I'll be gone afterwords so I don't see why I should wait,but whatever,I wish you all the best,goodbye"	sw
"I'm ready do vanish I'm 20 but i wish i killed myself earlier. I always help everyone, do anything i can to make other people's lifes better but noone appreciates that. Only my parents care about me, I have no friends at all. People say that you should be a kind person but it's bullsh@t, the nicer I am, the worse people treat me. I am Christian and I believe Jesus was kind to everyone but nowadays only ''cold'' people can make friends, have gf or success in their lifes. It's time for me to go but the only problem is that I can't do it the way I want, because weapon access is not available in my country. I feel sorry for my parents, I love and respect them so much but I have to end this asap. I've quit my job yesterday and now I'm ready to end my life, I have to do it, there is jo place for people like me on this word, I'm just a parasite, a useless and worthless piece of crap. "	sw
"Just finished Death Wish 1974. The ending was chilling. Spoilers! So, his wife died from assault. His daughter was traumatized.  Then he went out there looking for muggers and criminals just like Bat-Man. Then he shoots them. On a killing spree.  In the end, he saw a bunch of rowdy hooligans harrasing a girl. He picked up her things then smiled at them by making a shooting gesture.  Damn, that smile was chilling as hell. Pretty freaky and scary. Looked like a predator. Loved it.  That scene was my favourite.  Should I watch the rest of the sequels?"	cc
"Friend lost his from home job to India. They had him train them too under the ruse of expansion only to lay off his whole team.   IDK if one of the reasons for tighter immigration control is still to keep our jobs but these companies sure will find a way to out source jobs for less anyways. Companies don't care where the work comes from, and as things become more and more digital we are just inevitably going to be competing with the world for jobs anyways (or so I suspect). "	cc
"Last call of sorts I used to think nothing in my life could get worse, that it was as bad as it possibly could get. That was summer of 2017 to winter 2017. Now into 2018 I have been brought the brunt of my wishes, everything has gotten somehow worse. I’ve been kicked out of my house, struggling to find a roommate or even a place to stay, I’m giving up education to avoid homelessness atm, as well as cut off from health insurance. I already am employed constantly since I was 17 & now 19 with 3 part time jobs and full time school. I am barely making half 1k a month on part time, even though this is somewhat of a headstart against my financial costs that are being dumped on me at once, I am also 2k in debt thanks to ONE trip to the ER last fall. My relationship with my significant other, who I depend on since I’m isolated from others due to me never being able to enjoy life as a person, is falling apart. I’ve relapsed in nearly every realm of the word I could relapse. I’m lamenting this on a forum for some sort of condolences that I am unable to get anywhere else. Trust me I’ve tried to reach out.  I’ve contemplated suicide more often than I have actually done anything in my responsibilities. I just want a confirmation that somebody even if I don’t know them, cares about me, somebody that wants to help me. If not, then it ought to be my time to leave."	sw
"Should I / Do I need to leave a suicide note I'm going to do it Soon, should I leave a note for my family or would it just hurt them more "	sw
"I don't want this life anymore I never was a person that talks about problems with others. I keep them to myself, i lie almost everytime to everyone. For everybody they think i'm Ok, but inside i am suffering. With this lie problem, I just got dropout college because of my grades, and my mom hates me because of that, she cries everytime when she talks to me, so I can't see her face anymore because i don't want to see her crying over me and my family disappointing. She thinks that I put my future on the trash. I'm poor and I manage to get a pretty good university on my country, but I get dropped out. I'm alone, the only time i feel OK, it is when i am at my PC, to avoid all the troubles, but i know i can't live a life in this way, so i'd rather die than face my reality. Sorry telling this, but I do not know what to do.  It's like the Biggie song, Suicidal Thoughts: ""I know my mother wish she got a fuckin' abortion She don't even love me like she did when I was younger"". So this is my thoughts right now"	sw
"Going through major transformations I’m 25, from New Jersey living in Florida. I moved here to get treatment for my substance abuse and put that life behind me. It’s been rough, I’ve fallen on my face a handful of times, but things are on the mend. I never imagined it would be this tough to get my life back on track, but Ive derailed my life so bad so it’s only natural I suppose.  Today things are good, however, and I’m very grateful for that. "	cc
How common is it to have constant suicidal ideation for years? I'm not sure when the switch flipped but I can't remember the last time i woke up or fell asleep (and everything in between) without ideation. Suicide has been on my mind since i was a child but i know thats not super uncommon. As always I'm just kind of looking to relate to someone.	sw
"I'm not built to be around people. I need to either shut myself off and live as a hermit or die. I'm 20, I have autism and I'm extremely socially inept. I make people very uncomfortable when I'm around them. I cannot hold a conversation and I have no idea how to formulate my thoughts into words when I'm forced to talk to people. I'm not made to make friends or be social. If a higher power made me, they forgot to add a personality. I read this book about a man who decided to seclude himself in the wilderness of Maine and live in complete isolation for 30 years, only saying one word (""Hi"") the entire time. If I were able to replicate that somehow, I feel like I would be happier and the general population would be better off without my presence, even if I were to just live off grid in a mobile home or something along those lines. I'm destined to be the weird hermit that everyone's scared of. And if I can't do that, then I'm comfortable with leaving the planet and doing a solid for the population. My presence in society has no purpose other than to make others afraid. I cannot live with myself if that's what I'm here for."	sw
I can’t do this anymore I know a lot of my struggles aren’t as severe as others and I probably don’t have a place to say anything like this but I seriously feel like I have no place being alive anymore. I feel like I’m constantly ruining everything and I feel like whether I’m here or not wouldn’t matter to anyone. I’m not diagnosed with anything and even if I try to talk to someone about how I’m feeling like to my mom I just don’t think she would listen. I’ve been to counsellors and therapy before and my mother just told everyone how she thought I felt because even when I flat out try to tell her how I feel about things she cuts me off to explain how she thinks I feel. It’s not just that it’s just I don’t know how to seek help without feeling like I might be imagining how I’m feeling or feeling like no one will listen or care. I’m ruining the one good relationship in my life because of all of this and I just don’t know what to do anymore and I just don’t want to be here.   I don’t think any of this makes any sense and I apologize I don’t even know why I’m writing here I guess I just would like some advice to keep going idk I just feel worthless and hopeless lately and like I have nothing left to live for	sw
I wish I had died when I attempted. Even when I tried to kill myself I still had friends.   Now I don't.  	sw
"Thinking of suicide, only option left. I’m not in immediate danger, I don’t want anyone to panic. But I’ve been thinking of suicide. I just got out of hospital a few days ago and nothing has changed and I’m back to my only option being suicide.  I’ve had depression since I was a child and I’ve been through so many medications and therapies, I’ve exhausted all the resources provided and I’m still the same. I can’t have a normal life. I’ve tried researching other options but there’s nothing.  The only thing left to do is to kill myself, I don’t even want to die, I just don’t want to live like this anymore. "	sw

It is a small dog and has been re homed twice before, i hope i can give it an for ever place.

"I just need to get this off my chest I was dating this AMAZING girl for about three months now. Things were going great and I was enjoy every second we spent together.  Fast forward, and my 50 year old co worker comes up to me and says ""isn't this your gf?"" And shows me his POF app. She's on there basically selling herself to ""rich daddies"" (She's 18 and gorgeous).  I confront her on text because I'm still at work. She comes clean that she's been fucking other guys on the side for cash. Sometimes in MY BED.  She had my credit card from earlier for a small purchase. Once all this is out in the open she maxes out my card (about 10k) then jumps on a plane to a different province.  I still see her on POF... I made an account to try to contract her. Not sure why.  I really don't even care about the money. I thought I was going to marry that girl though.  Oh. Also my childhood dog was run over this weekend. So that's fun.   Tldr:  The girl I was going to marry breaks my heart and my dog dies.     Not really sure why I'm posting this. I'm just feeling really really down and I desperately need the support. I'm at the point where I really don't care if I wake up in the morning. I think I'd actually prefer that."	sw
"Are there other married men without any friends? (On Mobile) I (31yo Male) am happily married and enjoy my life. I have a fulfilling career, wife that I love, a baby on the way,  and two dogs. However, aside from my wife, I don't have any male (or female) friends. I moved to Florida over 5 years ago to change my life, I was a heroin addict. Had some fellowship through AA but not anymore. Unfortunately part of AA is people falling off the map and I don't attend meetings like I did in early sobriety.   My wife is having a baby shower next Saturday and said, ""The girls are coming over at 10, do you wanna hang out with the guys out of the house?"". That's when it hit me, what guys? I don't have any friends. I have two brothers who I love but both are up North.   I am not complaining or any sort of ""woe is me"" stuff. Just acknowledging that I don't have any friends outside of family.   Anyone have this situation going on? How do you make new friends at 30+ years old?"	cc

"I haven't even tried suicide and I already feel like a ghost I feel like a ghost. Other than with my parents, it feels like if I'm not anywhere near anyone in person they just forget I exist and proceed to do stuff without me. No one texts me even when they have something that might interest me or anything and anytime I try to talk with them it feels like the responses I get are equivalent to just ""Yeah"" or ""uh-uh"".  It's like if I'm not here anymore nothing would really change. No one thought to even try anything when I posted an image of a cat captioned with ""I'm bored, entertain meh"", which I did to incite some conversation or something but no one responded  It feels like anything I do is ineffectual to anyone, so why should I still bother not being a ghost?"	sw

"Introducing: The New Mods of r/CasualConversation! As you may have noticed, there's a few new mods around these here parts. Please feel free to AUA (ask us anything) over the next few days, we'll be happy to answer :)  Be warned: This is going to be an ENORMOUS post (pushing 5,500 characters).  **HysteriacTheSecond**: Salut! I'm /u/HysteriacTheSecond (although perhaps that part is redundant since my username is provided anyway), or Emily for short. Feel free to call me anything, though; I really don't mind! \^_\^ Other little tidbits: I'm from a little village in the north of England, and I'm likely one of the younger moderators here at age seventeen.  I really am so excited to be a part of the community here at /r/CasualConversation. I've always seen this subreddit as a great bastion for a combination of the wholesome and friendly nature for which all subreddits should strive with the great size that makes such an achievement often nearly impossible. I, of course, know that this is partly down to the fantastic work put into the subreddit by the moderation team, and to be able to help the team with this goal is something about which I am incredibly proud.  My passions often rest within the avant-garde: I adore delving into all that is 'out-there' in the arts, from James Joyce (favourite: *Finnegan's Wake*) in literature, to David Lynch (favourite: *Inland Empire* / *Mulholland Drive* / *Twin Peaks: The Return* / [Oh gosh I have no idea](https://imgur.com/a/grlhL)) in film, to Autechre (favourite: *Chiastic Slide*) in music, to Francis Bacon (favourite: *Pope I*) in fine art. Bar the arts, I also adore philosophy; catching up with the Nintendo Switch's first year; playing Dungeons & Dragons, among other board games; staring at pictures of buns (preferably [king buns](https://xkcd.com/1682/) but I'm not fussy); and spreadsheets.  :-)  **SoapyTheBum**: Howdy! I'm SoapyTheBum, you can just call me Soapy. I live in New York, right in the suburbs of the city.  I'm so happy to be part of this community because of how much I really enjoy being here and engaging with all of the other people who are just looking to shoot the breeze. The relaxed atmosphere, the friendly mood, the encouraging responses all come together to create just a wonderful community that I'm not only glad to be part of, but also proud to be part of.  While I have a lot of hobbies, the ones that I seem to talk the most about are cooking and reading, and I'm always willing to talk about either those things, as well as any other topic that I'm either familiar with or interested in.  Other hobbies that I enjoy are: board games, dungeons and dragons, video games, and pop culture, and music.  **Lousy_Try_Brian**: Hey, everyone! My name isn't really Brian (I'm actually a woman!) so you can call me Lousy. :) I'm so excited to join the team!  I love r/CasualConversation because it embodies the best of the internet: a place where strangers from all over the world can share in pleasant conversation without the usual trolling, hostility, and other ugliness that creeps in so easily. I am so grateful to have a chance to join the mods and contribute to this awesome sub!  I'm from the great, if misunderstood, state of Utah in the USA. I'm in my 30s, so I think I may be one of the older mods. I work as a technical writer by day, and in my free time I love to bake delicious things, read interesting books, and spend time with my family. I'm looking forward to seeing you all around the sub!  **Mel_Pond**: Howdy y'all! My name is Mel, or Melody, or even River Song if you want (Yes, it's definitely a Doctor Who reference). I've always loved the strong sense of community in the sub and I'm insanely happy to give back however I can! I'm definitely the youngest of the mod team, and I'm also a fairly artistic individual. I look forward to the next few months!  **Love_The_Heat**: Hi everyone. New guy. A quick blurb about myself?  It all started when my life was flipped and turned upside down. I was born and raised in Philadelphia where I spent a lot of time at this local playground where we mostly chilled, relaxed, and shot basketball.  One day these no good guys started trouble and we got in a fight. It was crazy actually. One guy picked me up and swung me around in a circle on his shoulders. I bet it looked crazy from above. Anyways, my mom got scared and sent me to Cali to live with my Aunt and Uncle. It's about 7 or 8 right now as I write this and I can't believe that I'm finally here with ye as the new Prince of CC.  My neck hurts, but nice to meet you!  **MattsOutrageous**: Hey guys! My name is Matt. you can also call me Adam (my middle name) if you prefer :) I'm based in the UK so I guess I'll be taking the morning shift ;)  I'm so happy to be a part of r/CasualConversation because I absolutely love the community here. Everyone seems to be invested in others and supportive, caring, kind... You're all fantastic. Above all, y'all know how to have a conversation, casually.  I'm definitely not the youngest in the mod team at 24 years old, but I don't think I'm the oldest either!  I'm a huge fan of video games. I work in a game dev studio for my day job and I'm working towards being at least a semi-pro hearthstone player. If anyone plays and wants a friendly game, don't be scared to shoot me a message :)"	cc
"Self-medicating to keep from killing myself So, I’m newly diagnosed with a pretty bad case (wtf does a good case look like?) of Bipolar 2 (heavy on depression, light on mania). I also have PTSD. Right now, I don’t think I can function in normal society. I keep trying, but if I’m Manic, I make shitty life choices and ruin my life. If I’m depressed, I will try to kill myself (three times and counting). So, when I’m manic, I take a light dose of Benadryl to dull my brain. When I’m depressed, I take a heavy dose to sleep so I don’t kill myself. Like, this is where we’re at right now. I’m self-medicating just to survive.  Obviously I’m not on real meds yet. My therapist has this stupid as fuck “well, let’s wait and see” approach, and waiting and seeing is totally ineffective. I think she’s afraid I’ll try to OD, but my best friend is a psychiatric nurse and would help keep me safe from myself for as long as it took for me to get “balanced”. She has already offered this outright.  Been casually looking at guns again and trying to plan my funeral, so I’ve self-medicated again. Considering smoking a bowl, too, but idk how Benadryl interacts with cannabis.   I’m supposed to be in college, right? Getting my degree, working, writing my books on the side. But I. Can’t. Function. I have these EXTREME mood swings out of nowhere, all my emotions are turned up to 11, I can’t make good decisions by myself, and I’m really fucking up.   I don’t think I’d qualify for any government funding just for being bipolar, but I keep quitting jobs during manic episodes and getting fired or dropping out of school in depressive ones. Like, I am legit one bad move away from being homeless. And it’s only gotten worse. I’m 22, and everyone keeps telling me this disorder gets worse with age.  Idk what I’m gonna do. But I feel like killing myself, sooooo that’s my immediate concern."	sw
Just need to know someone is there I struggle to ask for help at times. Am going through a bit of a rough time with anxiety and stress right now. I’m driving myself crazy in my own head. Just needing to know someone is out there. Just needing some virtual company and some distraction.   How do you keep it all together? 	cc
"I want to kill myself but am scared of what comes after. Really young single dad, going through a divorce with a women who is a meth addict and just want to die. I’ve taken anti depression meds, anti psychotics, anti anxiety (benzos), add meds (amps), and nothing helps me feel better. Everything is so foggy and I don’t even know if this is real. My child would be better off with my parents. My child loves them and would have a two parent home instead of a dad who could never be good enough. There is a reason I have no friends and no one talks to me. I fucking suck. Anyway I’m ranting. I just really wish someone could tell me what the fuck comes after this. So I at least know before."	sw

Have you ever noticed how people describe their heritage? I notice people like to define themselves by their last names. Just because your last name is Irish doesn’t mean you can go around saying your Irish. Must just be a pet peeve of mine. My last name is German but I am not German. I’m American with a German last name and German heritage. 	cc

My grades are awful and I'm probably going to lose my scholarships soon, I have no friends at college and my friends at home are moving on with their lives without me. I started self-harming about a month or two ago and now I can't stop even though I know how unhealthy it is. Basically, I'm a worthless piece of shit who would be better off dead and I already have a plan for how I'm gonna do it. I don't know why I'm even posting this here, I guess it just helps to know that someone sees it."	sw
I live in New Orleans and in the last couple months the city has put up on basically every street corner these flashing red and blue crime cameras.

I changed the language on my phone to Chinese My Chinese is garbage so I switched the language on my phone in hopes that it'll help me with reading/writing. Trying to navigate the settings is a fun time for me.  In other news: I made banana bread today and it was beautiful. 	cc

"Smartphones (#86) I have mentioned it a few times before, but I'll repeat here--I have a flip phone. I've had it since Oct. 17, 2009 and it has worked well for the past 8+ years. It's called the Alias 2 and [here is what it looks like.](https://imgur.com/a/IAffN) People are usually impressed by the fact that the buttons change depending on how it is flipped. Other than that though, my friends have given me shit for this phone for since probably 2011.   As smartphones became more and more prevalent to the point where it's rare to know anybody who doesn't have one, my phone has become more obsolete. My friends have given my phone many nicknames, include ""the brick"" or ""the toaster.""  I'm able to call, text, and take surprisingly decent quality photos ([example here](https://imgur.com/nbXAO2e)) and that's I really have needed for so long. Sure I can't get group texts or emojis (and honestly, since the IOS 11 update getting texts from iPhones in general sucks) but for the most part I have no issues. If I need to be connected to something I'll use my laptop or my iPod.  However, I'm very aware that my time for owning this phone is coming to an end. Even though the battery life is still fine, the phone has been giving in some ways. I can no longer text when I am at a subway station underground. Sometimes the phone will randomly shut itself off even with a full charge. And for a future full time job (especially since as a dog trainer I'll have to be in contact with clients and stuff) I know I'll need to get a smartphone to do that. Hell, I was looking at job postings recently a couple listed owning a smartphone as a requirement. I also should have access to Uber/Lyft as well and other important things like that which make life easier.  I just don't want a smartphone. I hate how big they are. I hate how confusing they are. I hate how connected to the world I can become no matter where I am. I see it in myself already with just my iPod and laptop if I have wifi, I am constantly on reddit/social media. I don't want to get sucked in even more with no restrictions.   I begrudgingly told my mom that I guess my graduation present should probably be a smartphone even though I don't want one. She knows I wish I could have my flip phone forever but as someone in their early 20s in this time in history, it's nearly impossible to do much without one. She asked which I would want to get, a galaxy like her and my dad, or an iPhone like my brother. And I honestly don't know. While I hate Apple as a company cause they are cheap and don't seem to give a fuck about their consumers, iPhones are so much easier to use. At least in my experience.   So I turn it to all of you to debate what type of smartphone I should get (with actual objective facts).  ^^^^^^^^^^.  ^^^^Trying ^^^^to ^^^^not ^^^^use ^^^^the ^^^^same ^^^^exact ^^^^questions ^^^^I ^^^^used ^^^^in ^^^^my ^^^^22nd ^^^^post ^^^^because ^^^^that ^^^^was ^^^^on ^^^^a ^^^^very ^^^^similar ^^^^topic  In what ways has owning a smartphone benefited you?

"What are you guys doing for the first time? I got done with the 2nd round of auditions for my high school's play The Laramie Project yesterday, and I'm really excited to see what part I get (If I get to be in it at all). It was a group audition, meaning we had to act out a scene with a group of random people and it was so much fun working with people who I've never even talked to before  I've never done any sort of acting, public speaking, or theater before but it just clicked the second or third time we practiced the scene. I'm so glad that my friend made me try out.  What are you guys trying for the first time? Have you ever been in theater / public speaking?"	cc

"Going through mind-numbing drudgery at the end of college B.tech. is about to get over this month. Finished my final year project, got it to work, submitted it as a paper to a conference (ICECA 2018, if you're interested).   Now all that remains is writing my report on it for the final review and SWEET MOTHER OF HADES IS IT BORING!  Kill me now. (Don't actually kill me, just talk instead)"	cc
"Does anyone else answer ‘No’ to being asked if you’re suicidal or have had suicidal thoughts recently? Sorry if title is weird. It’s late and I’m typing this on my phone so I’m not very good at articulating.  Anyways some back-story: I’m 20F and have probably been suicidal since I was 16. I’ve been to a mental hospital once in high school and hated it, I went in for suicidal tendencies I guess, like I didn’t attempt suicide but I was afraid I would try something so I told my mom and she took me to a hospital which I was thankful for but at the same time it just wasn’t the best experience. I have a very supportive family especially my poor mother, just writing this out makes me cry because I put her through so much and she never asks for anything from me except that I live and I’m trying really hard just for her. Ugh okay back to my main point sorry.   Recently I’ve noticed that during my therapy appointments I find it easier to just say I’m not suicidal or have no suicidal thoughts, but this isn’t true at all. In fact I think my suicidal thoughts are returning at full force and there’s no one I can tell except strangers on the internet. I want to tell someone in my life what’s happening but I’m afraid I’ll get pulled out of college and referred to a mental hospital. This can’t happen again considering I took a year off for my mental health last year.   I really want to talk to my therapist about what’s going on but I’m really worried that as soon as I mention the thoughts she’ll pull me out, is that what happens? If I do tell her I’m struggling and suicidal can she really just snap her fingers and have me sent away?? I know she wouldn’t but I feel like I have to be careful with what I say. I don’t know what to do but I don’t want to leave college again, I just want to finish out the year that’s all I want.  Thank you for reading "	sw
"I don’t want to die I love life. Waking up refreshed, doing something selfless and nice, being appreciated and feeling good about yourself. I want to live but the pain’s too much sometimes. I’m trash and I don’t deserve life.   One day I could love someone. Maybe a girl or another guy. Maybe they’re people or intelligent robots, idk. I just have so much love to give but I don’t know how to give it and who to give it to. I want people to feel good but it’s hard for me to show affection.   It hurts knowing people love you only because they’re blind or feel morally obligated to. I want to earn love. That’s all I want :/  Everyone who reads through the posts here and tries to help others, I love y’all. I really do, but I don’t know how long I’m staying on this Earth for.

A person who saw passed everything and loved me for what i am; weither i blew the whole thing and other 3rd party circumstances pushed that aside and i slip back to what i was before, empty.  I know shouldn't let a relationship be the thing that keeps me grounded but its the only thing i ever wanted / looked forward to.

"I jumped, but I missed. Hi.. In November 2017, I jumped from a 7 story bridge. I fell into the creek below and when I came to I swam to the side and laid in the mud for 4 hours until help arrived.

Then I jumped. I found a new way to kill myself online, I want to order poison under a false identity.   I have mental problems.

"I really hate when people honk for minor or no reasons. Remember that time, you had to stop at a red light and after it turned green again, it took you one second to actually process it and start driving again? Too late, you got that loud honk from the car behind you, making you feel like a total human garbage. Or when you sprinted across the road when the car was 5 minutes away and they still honk to show you that they are much more clever than you are and that you shouldn't EVER cross the road in front of them AGAIN.  Everytime someone honks for no reason or a minor reason often cause by their little to no patience, I want to turn into every GTA character ever and throw them out of the car onto the road.  I don't know if it happens so much in my country only or if this is a worldwide thing (Actually, I've traveled quite a lot and I haven't see it so much elsewhere) so I'm really curious if you guys hate this too or even if you are that person (No worries, I won't judge you) I feel like my friends do not get angry about this and they even honk at every opportunity they're given, so I want to know if I'm weird or this is a common thing.

Irreversibel MAOIs are not approved in my country, I think or I wish that they could work if they were available here.    I don't want to kill myself at all and I have no intention of doing so, I wish I could fix it all but deep down I know that it cannot be fixed and that death is the only possible solution.

"I have a date Well, as the title says, I have a date... April 16th 2018, that’s when I’m committing suicide.   Allow to me to explain, Ive been suicidal since I was 12 (I’m turning 22 at the end of this year). My childhood was absolute garbage, I was emotionally abused by both my parents up until my parents separation in high school. I was bullied relentlessly in elementary school, suffered severe depression in high school, an eating disorder in high school, have seen a handful of different therapists for many different reasons, (depression, gender dysphoria, eating disorders etc.) and have had 0 help from any of them.   No matter what I do, no matter what help I try to get, or how I try to change, I always feel the same. Like I want to die, and it’s gotten to the point where I can’t handle it anymore. I can hardly afford my rent, and am at risk of getting evicted every singe month, I’ve been on and off addicted to cocaine since I turned 18, never had a single relationship, dropped out of college, there is absolutely nothing good about my life whatsoever, and there never will be.  I know I have friends and family that will be sad, but I don’t think any of them understand how hard I’ve fought over the past ten years to stay alive because of them, I can’t do it, I physically can not do it.   So there, I have a date. April 16th 2018. I’ve started writing out some letters to people I know will want an explanation, and now I just need to figure out how. Last time I tried overdosing on pills and sadly I lived, I need to try and think of a more efficient way. I’m thinking I’ll either jump off the bridge I cross on my way to work, jump in front of a car, or slit my wrists, I don’t know, I don’t care about pain, I know death is peaceful and I know this is what I want.   Bye "	sw
"How do you help a stubborn friend? My friend has been messaging me, telling me she's frustrated because she had to redo a research task, an assessment due to not having enough detail.  She has to finish an assessment that is due tomorrow (but honestly we get a lot of breaks, like trust me I love having a break, I was known in school for asking when break was but we get way more than we need. I use one of my breaks to study each day in the library and I still get enough food, I go and socialize with people and it's cut down on my time at home a lot) we also get offered free study help on multiple days (in which she's told me she should go to the one I go to, but she never shows up. It's a one on one free tutor) and my teacher gives us a bunch of time in class to get bits of the assessment done, so really she should have majority of it done)   We also have an exam coming up, and she told me she hasn't studied for it at all (it's a completely different topic to the assessment) I told her she should start at least doing flash cards and she said to me ""No I need to get this assessment done""    Now I know the rotating work theory doesn't work for everyone, but her focusing on one task clearly puts her behind with her other work and makes her not preform as well (she is smart and capable) so I told her she needs to start rotating work so she can get bits of each done and she just refuses. But then she complains to me that she's behind in everything.   I said to her ""this an an example. I am going to do this for 30 minutes than this for 30 minutes, then take a little break, then this for 30 minutes and so on"" her reply was ""no I'm not doing that""  She tells she doesn't have enough time, but honestly half of the time on our breaks she just sits on her phone and does nothing, she eats at the other breaks. She doesn't even really talk to people when she's on her phone.  Mind you she doesn't have a job, she doesn't do chores and honestly I have a lot less time to get things done than she has. She complains that she never gets to go out for dinner or enjoy stuff yet I do stuff around the house, I go out and I get all my work done as well   Is there anyway I can help her?  "	cc

"Has anyone ever made a complaint about their psychiatric care? The last place I went to ""Get Help"" was at the VA. The largest health care provider in the US mind you and was not really surprised at the usual crap level of service I got there like most other places, for my mental health issues. I actually tried to make a complaint but that got me nowhere fast. I asked to see a supervisor at the VA and they were basically like, ""no ones coming"".....   Complaints from psychiatric patients are usually blown of since they are seen basically as crazy people by the majority of society regardless of what others may claim. Psychiatric patients are often seen as unstable or unpredictable therefore their claims are typically not considered or held with as much merit.  Any thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated since this is basically my life for a couple of decades.

"I never thought I'd get this far. Every day is a struggle and I never thought I'd make it as far as I have. My ex committed suicide right after high school and I always thought that if one of us did it the other would follow suit shortly after. I didn't but after 8 years I still feel like I should have.  I feel like I've lost control of everything. I'm going through a divorce that I initiated. I insisted it was the best decision for myself, but I feel so alone. I started talking to a friend of mine that shared mutual interest, but they seem to have lost interest and I'm not sure how to process it.

Then, after those, I decided to give Breaking Bad a try (after trying 1 episode a while back and not enjoying it). I just finished it. Fucking fantastic show. So the timelines just match up, and I could understand the references that Breaking Bad makes about the Colombian cartels and the DEA agents of old.  Then I decided to play Jotun: Valhalla edition since it was just sitting in my steam library for months now. Very much enjoyed it. Then, I figured, since I've finished Breaking Bad, time to watch American Gods after finishing Jotun!

"Feeling left out and very betrayed I'm leaving school this year, and since I've been there for 5 years and my depression began around it I decided to let it out for the last term. My friends took it as a joke at first, then just ditched me later on. The thing that hurt me the most is that I've been trying to communicate to a friend of mines on discord for the past 3 weeks, and she ignored me all the time. Meanwhile today she just said ""I called (anon) yesterday and his voice was low, I'm afraid he's depressed"". She knows of my cuts, and my attempts yet fucking just lets go off me immediately because she's ""Busy with stuff"", yet is afraid (anon) is depressed because he just toned down his voice a little? This really hurts me, and I can't fucking handle this bullshit anymore. Oh she's just over there tying a noose, let me pass onto (anon) instead, just because he toned his voice a little last time I called him for 4 hours! And I will just ignore her over there hanging on that stupid noose she made. I've been trying to tell her I want to talk face-to-face in private, she just doesn't care. Nor does anybody, and I'll fucking just end it on July if it stays that way, I've had enough of this bullshit. I tell them what's wrong they ignore me later on, I try to communicate better they let me go off like a fucking helium balloon. My own family tells me to ""get over it"", and my big sister encourages me to just end it all. And the fucking friends I thought were decent didn't give a damn about stopping their hurtful jokes until I've told them I hanged my fucking self.

"I absolutely do not believe in ghosts or the supernatural or paranormal or anything like that, but I can't shake this uneasy feeling in my new home. I recently moved into my late grandmother's house. She was a very heavy smoker and so the upstairs where she spent most of her time had to be totally remodeled. The downstairs is exactly the same though. She died in the house and I can't stop thinking about it. I also can't talk about it to my family because it makes them too sad and I don't want to drag old painful memories back up. We all believe that she died before her time.  I've never had reservations like this before and I truly don't believe that her spirit is in the house or anything. I know it's all in my head but I'm having a really hard time falling asleep at night and I get uneasy at every little sound. It gets worse when I picture the basement below me and in my head I think that the sounds are coming from there but I know that it's just regular street noises. It's the same kind of feeling I get when watching a horror movie. My grandmother was a wonderful lady and I love living in her house, I think it would have made her happy to know that it was staying in the family.

"I wish I had died in Summer 2016 That's when I got extremely ill and ended up in a hospital bed weighing in at about 125 pounds. For months leading up to that I had known something was wrong, but I thought it was all mental as it had been in the past. I sought out doctors and therapists while trying to hang onto the job I had only recently started at the time. Some of my issues were indeed mental, but most of it was due to a physical illness that culminated in a 109 fever and ambulance ride from one hospital to another.  In my hospital bed one morning a doctor came in and rather coldly gave me bad news regarding my health. For several months after that I was diagnosed with a host of other ailments at follow up appointments. In those months I lost my job, my home, and most of what little connection I had with my family.  Today I am healthier physically, but mentally and emotionally I have not recovered at all.  Anxiety keeps me homebound 27 days out of each month. I have no close friends. My family is more distant than ever. I turned 30 in November and I still can't work, or even go in a store without the absolute misery of social anxiety. Most of my possessions are long gone, and a guy who acted like my savior in the last several months completely cast me aside and left me with less than I had when we met. My memory has gone so dark that I barely remember the final months I spent in my own apartment before I spent 3 full days packing everything up with a body that was still frail and sickly.  Since then my life and my world is empty except for my dog. I feel very regretful at age 30 for not following through with suicide attempts in my teens and early 20's. I could have spared myself this lonely nothingness. I still can spare myself further years of a detiorating mind and body. And I ask myself why not? I will never have kids or a family of my own. My phone receives 97% junk emails and little else. I won't get married. I'm too terrified of social situations to connect with anyone. And I have a chronic illness for life to go along with my depression, anxiety, and supposed Borderline personality disorder.   Deep down I know it's time to stop this slow, pitiful crawl towards the grave and just roll in. I was never meant to be here in the first place. And now I'm not truly here anymore at all. I died in Summer 2016 in that hospital bed in every way but physically.  It's up to me to put things in ultimate sync at last."	sw

I thought I had switched all my autopay bills to my new card buuuuut turns out my car company didnt get switched (whoops). When I called to try and fix it they said the account was canceled and I would either have to pay my car off in full or let it be repoed and auctioned.

I wanted to make the experience for new viewers who might find the tv series on Amazon and Netflix enjoyable and just a very fun experience in general. So I messaged the moderator for some ideas to make the subreddit active and fun along with a recommendation for someone to be made as mod because they're very active and he said why not add me too.  Seriously that was really unexpected but now I really wanna rock this and make the subreddit (come say hi at /r/Imposters) really awesome. Do you guys have any tips in general for someone new to moderating? 	cc
"For some reason, I don't remember people's faces. I feel so strange that I can't remember people's faces, and this is targeted towards one girl only. I can remember other people's faces even if I met them once.   I met this girl 2-3 weeks ago, but I know her from the past 3 months. I kind of like her, so we text each other almost every alternate day. But somehow I don't remember her face. I literally have to try to think harder to her face pop up in my mind. It's so hard and I feel really helpless.   She isn't even on any social media for starters. I have 2 photos of her, but she looks different in the pic, so it ain't helping much.   Am i the only one or this happens with everybody often?"	cc
"I just had a Crunch Wrap Meal at Taco Bell and im feeling really guilty The title states the guilt. I'm literally still inside Taco Bell.   I'm sort of obese (80kg, fat percentage is 30%) and according to my gym trainer I should loose 5kg per month. I checked my weight yesterday and I've only lost 2.5kg for the past month. I felt somewhat shame when I heard that cause after loosing the initial 1.5kg within the first two weeks, I sort of ate some cakes, restaurant food and sugary drinks. Also, my family is going through a tough time and my dad is acting irresponsibly. I'm trying to break through all of these and get a good job and a good body and look at what I just did today. I feel like all of the working out I've done just went for nothing, which is not true since I had only one meal here but I guess I'm fearing that I'd be irresponsible in my eating habits in the future.

"I'm having a phenomenal week, and it's all because of the little things. I currently have the worst grade of my life in an incredibly difficult course, but I've been going to office hours and doing extra problems to try to improve.  It's slow going but I'm getting better and that really makes me happy :)  I also happen to have another week and half of classes until finals, then summer vacation!  I didn't get an internship like I wanted, so I'm going to spend as much time as I can with my grandparents and family and make some extra money on the side.    Last but not least, I got my squat max up to 340 pounds this week!  It's nothing crazy but I didn't start seriously lifting until last September so it's a victory for me.  I'm also only 20 pounds from benching 225, which is another major goal of mine."	cc
"How's your day?? Im feeling sick to my stomach today over school stuff 🤢 Had to submit my application to graduate today, on the last day i can of course, and it had my minor that I had dropped.. I went through and did the drop process online again, waited a bit and didn't get anything so I panicked and did the graduation application before I forgot about it.. get an email like ten min after that that the drop went through. I'm just so frustrated at myself but also just with the world, I had done the drop request for that minor before and I don't know why it wouldn't just drop. It just makes me mad. I emailed the registrar and asked them if they can do anything about it, no response yet.. I'm such a fuck up. I get excellent grades and then I go and do shit like this.   Sorry !!! I'm just playing farcry 5 now to keep my mind off it so if anyone wants to chat I'm very down. My interests off the top of my head are gaming, world affairs, history, superhero movies, vaping,  rap, anything really! I just wanna talk to people."	cc

"Writing Feedback? So, I went to the Chicago Art museum today, and in It, I saw a sculpture of a woman who accidentally killed herself through her own stupidity on her wedding day. So, a 'tragic hero', but what if the tragedy was not an accident? It's a bit inspired this myth, some Taming of the Shrew/12 Things I hate about you, and some of Remus & Romulus (Myth of the founding of Rome)     “You should do it sister, it will be fun” The sister of the bride encouraged, opening the chest at the foot of the bed. The bride gave a soft smile, and sat down in it. Her husband was downstairs, draining drinks at the reception. He loved surprises, right? She was sure, and she bent over, wrapping her arms around her upper legs. Her splitting image closed the lid of the chest, the iron hasp on the front locking it loosley. ‘Fool’ she thought to herself, as she draped the cover back over the chest. Then she put the heavy iron lock pin through the hasp, sealing one of their fates.  Somewhere along the line, she had been labeled as dumb. It was far from the truth. She had earned the label because she did not listen, and questioned authority. She was sharp as a razor, and cunning as a wolf. Her sister was an obedient and empty headed sheep. However, the sheep was the one who had hours earlier married the son of a rich nobleman. She was set to go to a nunnery.   “Remember, don’t make a sound, or the surprise will be lost” the wolf said, blowing out one of the candles, then the other, and then taking the third with her. She closed the door, and went down to the reception. At the head table was her mother, her father, the parents of the groom, and the groom. Her sister's seat was not the only one empty, but she took it.   It was actions like these that caused the negative connotations around her. Everyone knew the finances of the wedding. While they were not poor, they were not rich either. There was good money and many promises made for a hand in marriage. Just not hers.     What do you think? Any feedback is appreciated"	cc
"Had an offer accepted for my first home I’m buying today. Been smiling and shitting myself at the same time all day after finding out I’ve had my offer accepted to buy my very own flat/apartment, as a first time buyer.

Also sick to death after renting from a string of shitty landlords   I’m 25 and never thought I would see this day, let alone in my twenties, however after 3 years of saving and sacrifice.

"Why? I dont get it. Whenever i read reasons to not kill myself, their all the same.  ""People care about you"" fucking bullshit. If people cared, why dont they show it. Do i have to die before they do? ""Live for that next big moment"" and what? Fuck it up, like usual? Ive fucked myself over time and time again. Im heading down a path that is not good at all.   Words over the internet have no traction with me. I dont know you, much less care. You could just be a bot, i cant tell. People dont care about me, more so my contribution to society. You will have no effect on my decisions, or feelings. There is no posible way to show your compasion.  To tell the truth, im scared. If i confess my feelings, people will leave me, a lost cause. My friends will not do anything. They dont care. Every time they hear that someone is suicidal, they call them weak, attention whore. They are all i can get. To everyone else, i am a one trick pony. I can play football, but i am socially awkward, ugly, lazy.  I hope i die by overdosing. Ill die a happy death, something that is completely void from my life. Drugs seem to be my salvation, and hopefully my end.   "	sw
"I don't get it I dont know how to start this really.  When  I was 15, my parents split.  It wasn't messy or anything, it just was. I lashed out anyways, and got myself in a stupid situation, where I let myself get raped.  I never told anyone, I never spoke about it, I did a pretty good job holding it inside.   Almost 3 years later, I meet this girl.  She was everything I ever wanted, and I fell in love hard.  We did 4 years at different universities, and still, through all that, we stayed together.   9 years into our relationship I proposed.  She said yes and it was amazing.  My life was going where I dreamed it would.  A few months later, I find out she's sleeping with my best friend, regularly.  I loose it, I break it off, I move home, I quit my job. I fall apart.  I am fighting depression already, and then I see in the news... the man who raped me, is missing and presumed killed.   I see his face, and it all comes back hard.  I'm spiraling, I cant sleep, I have night terrors, I've put on 75lbs.  I live alone, I have a job, and it's a struggle to force myself to go... I'm so tired, I dont want this anymore, and i think about how easy it would be, to go for a drive, and put myself off a cliff or into a wall just to make the pain stop.  I dont know what to do anymore. I'm just so tired..."	sw

"Should I backtrack a little here? Am I applying to the right jobs? I’m a new grad and I’m applying to admin assistant jobs that pay 50-65k a year (live in a major US city). When I was in college, I interned as a program assistant at a campus organization, had one leadership role in a student group, and had a research position with a mentor. That’s basically what’s on my resume and I feel underprepared compared to a lot of other new grads, especially since my positions were in relaxing, chill, and very forgiving environments. I regularly talked and texted with my boss about stuff unrelated to work. I didn’t have a set schedule because it was a student job so I made my own and it was never full time, probably 20 hours a week.  Anyway, I’m getting called back for interviews from those 50-65k jobs. That’s a lot of money to me, especially for an entry level admin position. I’m afraid they’re going to expect a lot out of me and based on my work history, I’m underprepared. I have a FaceTime interview with the senior Vice President of one of these companies tomorrow. I’m definitely freaking out right now.  Should I stop applying to these jobs? I see a lot of admin jobs that pay $16-18/hr that I’ve been skipping over. But deep down I feel I should take these lower paying jobs first, maybe in a temp position, to test the waters before I get a “big girl job”. What do you think?"	cc

"I need help A little back story. I am a hard working 14 year old kid I have a job play 3 sports and maintain near perfect grades. I have never really had freinds that I hang out with outside of school due to sheer business of school and keeping some what fit. Well just recently I had a dream that made me Question if I'm doing everything wrong. The dream goes like this i was at a charity event and needed a partner at the event. This girl I know and talk to a little bit at school comes up to me and asks if I wana be her partner I say sure. Well we work together and have fun. at the end we hug each other and I felt a sense of such friendship, warmness and sheer caring for one another that when I woke up I was almost depressed. I Don't know why. I have no ambition for a girl freind. I have some decent freinds at school, I am doing good at all my sports I have good grades after that dream I felt my whole perception on life change. Some advice would be lovely."	cc
Rant and hospital visit I was in the hospital recently. I didn’t try to kill myself yet. I was in a car accident (rear ended and not my fault) and ended up with a concussion and they almost had to remove my pancreas. I was in terrible physical pain. I already suffer from CRPS chronic pain in my arm. So it was miserable. But not only that but in the hospital for a week I was alone. Only the nurses. My mom and a friend came to visit me once but I wanted to just die there so bad. It would have been so much easier on my family. They would have a reason. They would have a stranger to blame. My suffering could have ended and I wanted to so bad. I still have a plan in place. I still know it’s going to happen but that could have been so much better. I just wish I was gone and I wish that my family could have had the health problem to grieve over instead of a suicide.  Sorry for the rant. I just want to pain to end. 	sw
"Why I can't break up with my depressed girlfriend? Hello,  I have been with my girlfriend for almost 2 years now. The whole relationship I have felt I want to break up with her, but I haven't been able to. There is a lot of reasons why, I can tell you some.  Before we started our relationship, I wanted to just have sex with her, we were like friends with benefits. Then she started to want to have relationship with me, but I didn't want because I just got out of a relationship and wanted to be alone. One day she cut herself and was suicidal, and told me that she doesn't have reason to live. I thought I can save her from this, and I told her that we can start an relationship. I did not want a relationship, but I went in because I wanted her to be happy.  Then couple months passed, things were pretty great for first couple months, we had a lot of fun. Then we got some of our first arguments and she cut herself again, she said because she felt shes worst girlfriend in the world, because shes so needy and ugly etc.  Then the relationship became pretty manipulative, she once hit me drunk because I did not want to have sex with her. She is of course very sorry about her behaviour, and even cutted herself again, because she felt so bad person after doing that.  I think we are codependant with each other. I feel depressed and no-motivation when not being with her, though shes abusive sometimes. When I am with her and she has everything allright, I feel so good. Like if shes happy I feel happy. I feel like its my lifes job to keep her from negative thoughts. Also I don't know is it weird, we talk to each other like people talk to dogs and babies, in cute voice. I feel like shes my baby. I allways want to hold her thight and hug her when I hang out with her.  Good traits is that she is very caring, and pays for everything for me. She even bought Playstation 4 for me to her place, so I would spend more time at her place... And when we still had sex she did every my fantasy I could think of. She is my almost only friend too, we do everything together, go play soccer and ice-skating, swimming etc. And those days I really feel good. She also cared for me 2 days when I was sick, came to my place and took couple days off work because she felt like I was the most important thing. Though then she got sick couple months later and have been accusing me that I did not do the same thing. I feel like shes dream girlfriend, but not for me, now, with her abusive behaviour...  I once called cops when she was in apathethic suicidal very scary state. I got her in therapy for some time doing that and she took SSRI drug, because I told her that I will leave her if she does not try to get better. She stopped using those couple months back. She has borderline diagnosis.  I know I am in abusive relationship, or atleast have been, I think she has been not-abusive for couple of months now... She still tells me a lot that shes not getting enough sex, not enough attention and stuff. And that is true, I rarely see her couple times a week anymore. I make excuses why I can't see her because I have become anxious of faking my feelings, and I know I am about to explode soon.  I haven't given her single clue about that I am thinking about to leaving her. I live in constant fake feelings 24/7 with her. I think about breaking up with her like 20 times a day. I think about other girls. I think about going on vacations with my buddies, without her bringing me down. But theres a lot of reason why I am not able to do it. And I really think that I can't.  **One reason** I have delayed this, is that I allways think this is not the proper time to do it. I was graduating from school, I can't put up with the stress and depression now and fail everything. I was in my first job, I can't put up with the stress. She moved to new house I can't put up with the stress now on her. I got new job I can't put up with the stress now. She got a job I can't put the stress now on her. My step-father was diagnosed with cancer, I can't put up with the stress now.  Also, I am diagnosed with OCD, bad obsessive thoughts (harm-ocd, schiz-ocd, you name it) depression, anxiety disorder and depersonalization, which was so bad at one time I was becoming suicidal too. When I got with her, I forgot about all my OCDs, she assured me that I am okay and that I won't kill anybody (my obsessive OCD thoughts) that I could'nt hurt a butterfly. (read about harm-ocd if you don't know, I thought I was going to kill my whole family, still get it sometimes...), and that I allways helped me to assure that I am totally sane, that I am not going schizophrenic. (read about schiz-ocd if you dont know) She was allways there for me when my depersonalization became worse, holded me in her arms. She is allways there for me. Now when I leave her, I am going to lose human being who I was able to tell all my darkest things. I am going to get panic attacks, and there is no one who is to calm me down. I am going to get my schiz-OCD, think I am going insane and no one is there tell me that I am okay, calm me down and totally sane, its just my OCD talking.  **One reason** is that she is also depressed and suicidal sometimes, and I am her only one too who she can tell everything, I am there to calm her down. She has threatened to kill herself once if I leave her, that she can't do it on her own, and told it in very scary calming voice too, like she could really do it... If she really would kill herself because of the break up, I would have to live that for rest of my life, with my own mental issues too. Its too much.  Though it is so hard, I have decided to try to break up with her one month from now, once for all. This is where I would like some advice, how to make it better for me and her surviving it.  **One of the biggest problem** here is my feelings of guiltiness and pity. I feel guilty and bad conscience 24/7. I always feel like it, I know that I am not responsible of her happiness, but I feel like I am horrible person not to make so lovely person happy. I would feel so guilty to leave her, she has told me that she can’t live without me and that I make her life complete, and that I am the one for her. I feel so much pity towards her, her parents and her friends do not care about her, they’ve all ditched her, she is one of the greatest persons I know and cares so much, if I could wish one thing from a magic lamp it would be her to be happy and get over her mental issues and be happy without me. How I can shake this feeling of guiltiness, its eating me alive to feel so guilty and depressed all the time about this.  I have had seen so many emotional breakdowns from her, I know how it is going to probably go. Here’s example of her borderline seizure/panic attack whatever. She gets upset about something I say or do. It is like being in a haunted house first she become apathetic and will not answer to anything I say, then she will start shaking in bed and breathing very fast, ask me for to leave and let her go (probably meaning me to leave so she can cut herself) I try to calm her down by holding her and then she will punch me away from her, then she will start crying and shaking together, then her breath comes normal and she goes back to the apathetic mode, and is all blank, wants to kill herself, she will begin talking and blames me for her feelings of depression, until it goes to the part I am starting to leave, because I can’t take it no more, when I step out of the door she will start to realize what she has done and apologizes and is crying and begging me to stay with her, and then rest of the night she will try everything to make it out for me for blaming me. I am myself little manipulative because the part I am leaving in that episode, I am just doing it to get her to apologize to me and treat me better, I could not really leave there since I don’t want her to hurt herself. And I can easily always forgive her blaming on me, because I think it is because of her borderline, and she has no control over it and she is always very sorry and caring after those things. We have had fights and every time I have wanted to leave from her and go home she would physically grab me and not let go, tell me that she will kill herself if I will go. So I feel like it is not physically possible to leave her. But I can’t even get to that part because I am so emotionally unstable and codependent on her too that I will burst in to tears and beg her to stay with me, I will feel like it was the worst mistake of my life for couple of days, then I will again feel like I want to break up.   **I really need help how to break up with her. In this part is where in need the advice.** I have decided to really now do it, I took one week away from work like 20 days from now, and keep all of this inside me until then, so I can focus on it and recovering. First, I was thinking I maybe should write her letter why I want to break up with her, and go to her place and hand it to her. Then she will have emotional breakdown and become suicidal. I know it. Can I just leave her and drive away then, or do I have to comfort her? If I leave her she will really physically grab me and not let me go, I have been there before, with her. If I just force myself out of there, is it wrong thing to do? And then if shes really suicidal, should I tell it to her friend and sister? Her parents hate her, they are alcoholics. Maybe I should call the cops to check on her? What if she does not let me go, and is all out of control, how I can leave her alone?  I don't really know anymore what is wrong and what is right, this relationship and manipulation is making me go nuts. Am I doing the wrong thing, causing someone to suicide? I am really going insane about this, you probably can see it from my writing. The worst thing is no one has clue about this, and thinks we are perfect couple. I have been therapist about this, and he said that I should stay with her. Never gone again. Tomorrow I will probably see her and she will be perfect and I don't want to break up with her anymore. I am so mindfucked, please give me some advice. I dont want anymore to do things I dont want. I do things that make her feel good I feel bad. Help."	sw

"Years since I've been happy. I'm 22 years old guy from India, and my life has been a constant stress. Ever since my childhood, I've been blamed for something or the other. As a child, most of you must have lived a decent life, but mine was completely Outta fear for my parents who would hit me, trash me and would abuse me. Though they said loved me, they always kept hitting me, I remember once or a few times being hit with a steel rod on my head a few times for leaving home and playing. I wanted to pursue cricket, they put me in arts and dance, they wanted to make me a singer, and TBH I have a horrible voice. I was good at cricket my teachers encouraged me yet my parents didn't bat an eye cause in India, it's all about engineers and doctors. I've had a hard time having actual friends due to the nature of my dad's work. And he would always take out his frustration out on me, like I was a toy. I've been bruised enough physically and mentally. And then I feel in love with a girl for the first time, she loved me for who I was, this was when my situation was on the worser side of things, she was there when I was troubled and to make things worse, my parents took the liberty of breaking my relationship and ever since I've lost my will to live on. It isn't about love, it is rather about my parents destroying everything I hold dear to me. I took to gaming to move away from reality and they broke my laptop. And then hours of struggle and my university recommended to get me a new one for my project. But now I've even lost the interest to face away from reality and find happiness. Also, the people I've had interaction on the university is either them asking for favours or you remain anonymous. I'm done living, I'm not able to find happiness. I just don't know, but I've a strong feeling to die. Maybe, I wasn't a good son, or they weren't good parents, I'm the victim now and I don't have my will to live. "	sw

It feels like a relapse and it worries me and I really don't want to go through all this bullshit yet another time. I don't know what to do. I find myself thinking about pulling the plug, and actually doing research about it. I think the only reason I am not taking any further steps than that is because my gf is going through a lot of family issues and the last thing I want is to hurt her. How fucked up is that? I really don't want to live for my own sake, and I kinda wish I had no one whose sake I have to live for. Few things make me feel better, and those that do are fleeting, as warming and lasting as a match in the middle of a blizzard. I don't want to go on like this. It's so tiring."	sw

Unfortunately, telling my family isn't an option. I have a few friends, but only one I feel like I could actually tell.  Does anyone else feel like this sometimes?"	sw
"I upped my anti-depressants this week.. I increased my dosage of SSRI's on Wednesday, it's now Saturday and I'm just starting to feel a whole lot better. This morning I woke up, and as I was making coffee in the kitchen, I felt so peaceful and I realized my mind wasn't racing with intrusive thoughts.  It was such a god damned relief. I was doing everything I could to feel better- exercising, eating better, feeding my creative side.  and I still was so down.  I was having a hard time feeling any emotions at all, as hard as I tried to drum anything up.  But I just watched an emotional tv show and felt the tears well up inside of me and it made me SO HAPPY to be feeling things again.  Feeling anything but depression, even sadness, feels so wonderful.     Anyway, I just wanted to share. How's your weekend going, reddit? "	cc
"I don't know if I can do this any more I'm twenty-one and I've been dealing with a messed up head for eight years. Years of therapy and medications haven't done anything, neither has diets or vitamins or exercise or anything else that I've tried. I had to move back in with my parents because I can't take care of myself with day to day life, much less hold a job. My dad is always working and my mom tells me to get over myself and shape up so that I'll stop being a burden on my family, then turns around and says she loves me and wants to do whatever she can to help me. When I tried to take her up on that, she told me that what I said would help me would be an inconvenience for her and she won't do it. I've always had a history of self-harm, and it's been getting worse and worse. I've tried to overdose before but it didn't work, and I've started taking too many pills and cutting a little too deep in the last couple days. Not enough to be dangerous, but close. Nothing has been able to help me, I've isolated myself from everyone, I'm not interested in anything any more, and I've only gotten worse over the years. There is no light at the end of the tunnel. There's no light anywhere. I just want to be done with all this. I can't keep living like I am and there's no hope for things getting better."	sw

I don’t know how to cope with what I’m going through and it doesn’t feel like it’s safe to share it with anyone. I’ve been fantasizing non-stop about my death, and it’s scary.

"I just wrapped up a project exploring the power of human conversation through photography There is such an intimacy in the photographer/subject relationship that few other interactions can mirror. When a subject sits for a shoot, they thrust themselves and their vulnerabilities under the spotlight. Baring all for the lens. Opening up to whatever it may capture, good or bad. Trusting the photographer's perspective. Being sincere and genuine in their expressions.     For the photographer, there is a reciprocal attempt to be honest with their subject. To try to capture them as they are.  To try to view the subject as they view themselves.  For the duration of a photographer's shoot, the world stands still. Nothing else matters but the subject in that moment.  Every ounce and atom of the photographer's undivided attention is directed towards their subject. They listen to their subject so intently with their lens that they sometimes catch fleeting glimpses of their soul.    What if this was how we conversed? What if we talked like we photographed?    I have been obsessed with this notion of conversation for the last few months.  Obsessed with how to approach conversation for a specific purpose, the benefits of conversation, the different forms it takes.    This photography project began with the intention of ""capturing the essence"" of various participants but it's since morphed into something more.    We typically began with coffee/tea, where introductions are made and the project is explained.  After 10-15 minutes of casual conversation, we move the conversation to the photography studio, where I shift ownership of the conversation to the participant.  ""Talk about whatever you want"", I usually tell them. And the exchange that followed has been one of the most powerful, most humbling experiences of my life to date:    In that dim and private studio I have listened to grief. I have listened to pain and suffering and frustration. I have heard ambition and I have heard passion. I have heard happiness and excitement and hope.  The hills and valleys of everyday life. I've met heartbreak and then watched blossoming love chase it away.     There is something so so powerful about an open ear. About someone just willing to listen without judgement. Someone willing to block everything out and completely focus on your life experience for a few moments.   Often times, the participant would open up immediately, with very little effort, as if they had been waiting for the opportunity to share. Other times, participants were a little more hesitant and had their guards up.  The balancing act was trying engage in that beautiful interaction without imposing.    Many times, the room was on the verge of tears.  Many times the room was filled with laughter, echoing out into the halls.  Many times the sessions concluded with hugs and handshakes and the forging of friendships.  Many times the participants would express gratitude for the conversation, knowing little of how humbled I was for being allowed that privilege and how therapeutic it was for me.     I like to think it helped that the participants and I made a conscious effort to approach the conversation at equal level, instead of some sort of saved-savior dynamic.  I was not qualified to provide any sort of solution or feedback to things they discussed, nor did I want to, nor were they necessarily looking for that.  I simply wanted to listen and to be present in that moment. And they simply wanted to talk.      And so I'd like to continue.  I believe we can soothe the suffering, the frustration, the anger, the pain, the sadness that consumes our world today, one person at a time.  One conversation at a time, one photo at a time.      If you or someone you know is interested, get in touch with me through the Contact page and I would be honored to lens you my ear. "	cc
"So idek how to title this but here we go Well, idk where to start. My life was absolute shit around 5-6 months ago and before, but recently I got a girlfriend and have somewhat stopped having blackouts and haven’t really lost any time. Tbh school was going great, social life even better, and family contact (I’m in a care home) was going great too. But all out of nowhere I seem to once again have no friends, school is now going awfully and the literal only thing that I haven’t ruined is my girlfriend who I am now struggling to be able to see (irl) because of me fucking up other things. I’m fucking trapped, I felt like I escaped but I’m trapped. I haven’t noticed time loss but conversations I could’ve sworn I’ve had haven’t actually happened and ones I don’t remember are referenced. I haven’t slept in weeks because I wake up to whispers and sometimes hear them before I’m actually asleep. I’m just at a loss. It all looked good and I don’t even know where it went wrong it’s fucking bullshit. It’s all fucked all of it."	sw

"Anxiety? Hey reddit! How’s everyone’s day going??? Let’s talk about anxiety. Okay so who has suffered from anxiety? How bad was it? How did you fix it?   Also, okay so most commonly when you ask someone why they’re anxious they’ll say something along the likes of afraid of being judged or being laughed at if they mess up and this has been me for most of my life BUT it’s been a while since I really did stop caring about that type of stuff.  And since I stopped life has been so much better it really has but. If I stopped caring why do I still have anxiety? Most of it is gone but I still have some left, any ideas why?"	cc
"Still wanting to end it all. Hey reader,  I have not done this for years, but I've noticed that some thoughts just won't go away. I have some deep questions and wonder if anyone can shine some light on it.   Who am I: I'm 24 and living in the Netherlands. Had a nice youth on a small school and lot of friends. When I was about 12/13 I started getting these very negative emotions. The darkness in the future, the helplessness, the sadness. But it was mostly at night and could very well hide it from others. My parents aren't very good emotional helpers and didn't notice anything.    This continued growing older. I have to add that I have a brother who was very difficult at home. He was like depressed 24/7 since I knew him. (Now I know it's probably he's a bit autistic, just like my father.) I always tried to be the happy one, but that changed on my 18th. I started smoking a lot of weed and just didn't accept my parents anymore.    What is going on now? I just feel trapped inside a sick joke. On the one hand my social anxiety prevents me to get actual help. The depression just pumps these negative feelings in me all day. Also suicide related of course. My autistic side keeps me angry for years, it feels like the first day I was angry. But then everyday.    I want to keep doing my job, it's going very well. But I also want to put a knives in my wrists or heart. I want to have a girlfriend to share this with, but also wants to just disappear and never come back. I want to tell my close friends how I truly feel, but I also want to punch some of them to death.   Yes I'm afraid of death, who isn't? But the situation I'm in keeps giving me stress and I can't tell anyone about it. On top of that, 3 of my friends are in the same position.. but did tell everybody. All of them have been hospitalized and 2 of them have now been alienated from our friend group. We just can't recognize them anymore. The other one is babling for a year now how it all comes because of his OCD/ADHD and his parents.    I don't want to be a pathetic person who thinks he's important. Man.. the circles I went threw. How can I break this? Do I need to search for help? I only want to do that if I'm 100 procent sure I have something. But on the other hand I can ""play"" the human role very well.    I think I can never unseen the emotions and deep depth I have been in. It will always be with me, doesn't matter how much weed I smoke.    Sorry for the long text and English, but just wanted to write this off of me.   PS: no I don't feel like committing suicide right now, but It's something that has been following me for years. It's so scary."	sw
"Bummed about dream job salary Hey guys. First time posting, long time lurker.   Idunno. I just wanted to tell someone.   My dream job is a Mortician. The science behind death is very interesting to me. I also want to actively help people. I want to help those mourning. I want to make their passed loved ones look like they’re peaceful. I want to help them have closure.   But, the salary in my state for a starting mortician is 21,630.00. Which is not sustainable. So as an alternative, I’m going to be an EMT.

"Oh man, I fucking love my friends group We all have different personalities, different interests and different backgrounds. We have different preferences, different tastes. Besides this, we all share the same sense of humor. We all disagree on a lot of issues but we accept each other for it and don't hold any hatred towards each other. We help each other when needed and have lots of fun when we are all together. It's also half guys and half girls so we have diversity all around. It's so much fun.  I used to have such a group up until I was 12-13. Then teenage happened along with narcissistic parents and a new school, new place and family separated so I spent most of my time with internet. This trend continued till I was 18 and then I moved out for college. Im 20 now, haven't talked to my parents for about 8 months and feel really good. I hope they live a happy life but I ain't gonna be a part of it now. It took me 2 years in college to get myself on track. I was fucked socially and emotionally and I feel like I'm slowly getting it together. My friends are all extroverts but accept me for who I am and that's pretty cool."	cc
"viewpoints on suicide if i make this an analogy like by comparing this to lgbtq+ rights maybe that'll help. it's my right to die if i want to, (imo as long as it's non impulsive) just like it's lgbtq+ people's right to get married.  altho it can be argued that coming out will make other ppl sad bc it """"""harms them spiritually"""""" or """"""mentally"""""" or smthg weird & dumb like that we'd say no bc it only matters how the lgbtq+ person itself feels bc it's their desicion.    so altho you may think suicide is harmful for them, it's my choice.  i won't force you to marry the same gender if you don't want to, i just want you to let myself do it. in the same way, i don't want to kill everyone, just myself.  i rlly don't care if you want to do smthg that takes a lot of effort & is completely pointless. like have fun!!! i totally understand that you want to take full advantage of life bc why not? i have a chance to so might as well but i just want to be allowed to leave. i had a right to life, now i ask for a right to death.  i'll prob wait until i'm 18 tho if i still feel the same way then. ((tho i may purposefully be more clumsy in the meantime )) & i'll try not to stage it as a suicide bc i don't want others to feel bad despite the fact it's MY descion like i already argued, so altho i don't have to & this part is just optional i'll make it seem like an accident. maybe get into a car crash or smthg. but it doesn't rlly matter if anyone feels bad bc they will die too. this is just my opinion tho.   you cld also make it an analogy to women's rights or aborting or literally anything like that. & like i said before as long as it's NON IMPULSIVE it shld be allowed.  i'm not the only one who recognizes the fact that they just don't want to live. life isn't BAD like there's no problem but i just don't want to. it's useless. nobody gains anything from it. so you can if you want, but i'll pass. at most our society that we've created is just a solution to boredom. & why am i being forced to??? stupid peer pressure to live & my own cowardice to go against society are the only things stopping me from doing it rn tbh.  but at least once i'm 18 it can be a car accident or smthg & i won't feel bad.  i cant wait until society realizes this, & instead of shaming us or telling us that we're selfish, they help us & give us painless quick ways to do it or let us do it without worrying about how others think it'll affect us or smthg. i'm not scared by the pain bc i'll be dead haha. & we're all gonna die anyway, i'm just gonna choose when & make sure it's my own choice. i'm only shaving off some years anyway. i guess i'll miss out on some experiences but i am totally cool with that, but thanks for wondering. i'm really not curious at all. i'd rather just skip out on that. it's pointless & meaningless anyway. & even if you believe that there is some sort of a purpose, irdc about it. irdc about anything tbh. bc it'll all go away. anyway, i tried to explain my viewpoints to the best of my ability. btw, i'm not saying everyone shld die. just those who want to non impulsively shld be allowed to. i have the right for my life, & i also have the right for my death. my way.

I have my dream job of owning my own brewery and investors that have put nearly two million dollars into a project that is based 100% on my ideas and work. For some reason all of this is not enough and I still wake up every morning dreading the day that follows.   I feel numb and find it impossible to cry unless I'm intoxicated and then it all comes pouring out. I am diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder but stopped taking the meds (klonopin) a couple years ago because I was abusing them and nearly killed a man for calling my ex girlfriend a bitch while on it.   Five years ago I was in an accident and broke almost every bone in my body and somehow made a recovery; even after a MRSA bone infection inside my femur. Doctors thought I was drug seeking the whole time I had the infection and it wasn't until I sought a third opinion that I actually got treatment that saved my leg/life. I wish every day that I would have died in that accident or from the infection so that my family wouldn't have to go through the pain of having me kill myself. I have constant intrusive thoughts telling me to kill myself and sometimes even find myself saying it out loud unknowingly. I don't know what to do anymore, I've worn thin. I don't think I'll ever be happy. "	sw

"I cant figure out why I feel this way. I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for years now, longer than i care to admit. I always feel like an outsider to everyone around me. I always feel like I missed out on a joke someone said. I feel disconnected. I guess that’s the depression right? When I was 16-17 I was suicidal. And I never had any “real” problems. I just wanted to die. I hated myself. I hated how other people made me feel. I felt like everything was too much. It got to the point that I attempted suicide. I swallowed a bottle of pills, but nothing happened. Literally nothing. I eventually got over the suicidal urges. I still dealt with anxiety and depression, but nothing more than usual. I’m now 23 and I want to kill myself again. I also have no “real” problems. I have a family that loves me and I’m in a relationship with the most supportive bf, and i have a few close friends that I can rely on. But I have this urge in the back of my mind that keeps telling me to kill my self. I cant figure out why. I dont want to die. But I feel like I’m not in control. I’m already seeing a therapist, I have been for about 2 years. I am waiting to see a physiologist because my therapist thinks I should be on meds (I do too). But I feel like this urge is getting stronger all the time. I almost attempted to kill myself this weekend. I felt numb and just didn’t care anymore. This feeling is so scary. Hear me out. I. Don’t. Want. To. Die.  But some part of me does. I feel numb most of the time. I can distract myself and try not to feel this way. Work helps, friends help, and my SO helps. But eventually that feeling comes creeping back. It’s gotten to the point where my best friend has all of my potentially dangerous meds. I have the suicide hotline numbers in my wallet. I feel like I talk to my SO and my bff too much about it. I’m scared they’re gonna see me as just this depressed girl who can’t get her shit together. I’ve thought of all the ways to kill my self. I’ve thought of where I could do it. And what would happen if i did. Yeah people would miss me, but give them time and they’ll eventually get over it right?  I dont know why this is happening or why I’m feeling this way but I’m trying to stay strong.  I hope y’all stay strong too. "	sw

I am hoping to get a terminal disease at this point so that I don’t have to feel guilty about killing myself and how that will affect my family. I am 33 years old and I know my life isn’t going to get any better than this. There is no way I can do this shit for another 40+ years.

It's also nice to hear your neighbors go on with their daily routines. Like, hearing people say goodbye to their families as they're leaving for work, or hearing the scratching sounds of their brooms as they sweep their yards. There's also the sound of water hitting leaves, and the chains of dog's leashes as they get taken out for their morning walks. It's just nice to watch all that unfold. So yeah.

Maybe I will never consider anyone my friend, or that they like me, I will always wait for them to ask me or follow their every word literally and then be at fault when I get anxious. Apparently telling them I have trouble feeling like I can go with them isnt enough to understand I will feel left out if they just go without saying anything to me. I hate everything so much but even so I cant even draw a little blood.  Sorry for the rant, I just feel that I surely have just ruined the only friends I had and now I dont want to see them face to face again because of how scared I am.

"I miss the way the internet used to feel I started going on the internet a lot (like A LOT) when I was a young kid, and have been a heavy user since, so I know that is in large part just general nostalgia, but I really miss the way the internet used to feel.  I'm mainly thinking back to 2005-2007ish times when the internet was becoming more of the 'thing' it exists as today, and idk man. It just seemed like there were so many different subcommunities and online groups/sites with their own flair, culture, inside jokes, and overall so much bright silliness and creativity (not that there wasn't lots of bad things, trolls, etc. etc.). Now it feels like there's just some 'big' websites that feel more or less the same, and maybe really small interest-specific blogs or pages on top of those.   For me being on the internet (recreationally) used to feel so much more exciting, like you were always discovering new sites or communities or memes or whatever. And more than that it was almost secretive(?), or I guess people never talked about much internet going-ons or memes irl. Now, with phones and social media like Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit tbh the 'real' and 'online' worlds have more or less merged, or at least finding the divide is much more difficult.    IDK, like I said, this is all pretty much me just being nostalgic over my childhood and making 2006 internet sound much more special and amazing than it actually was.   But does anybody know what I mean/miss the magic of 'old' internet culture and web 'surfing'?  PS. One of my favorite forums ever to lurk when I was younger was twIMDB.

I've always had a lot of thoughts about death, but I've never really had suicidal thoughts I don't think. Lately, however I have been having them - to the point where I have a plan now. Actually 2 plans, but regardless I have plan. I don't have a time frame or anything. I just know how I would do it if I decided I wanted or needed to. A few weeks ago I finally got an appointment scheduled with a counselor again. I'm suppose to meet with her next Monday. I had decided that I was going to tell her when I met her, but now that it's getting closer I really don't know. I'm really scared about what will happen. I'm scared that she'll want to hospitalize me. I don't know if I can take that. I don't know if I would be able to look at my family and friends again if I go to the hospital. I honestly am fairly good at hiding my depression, so I think it would really catch everyone off guard. I think it would really hurt a lot of people if I ended up in the hospital. I just don't know if I should be honest from the go, or just ease into things. I don't have any immediate plans to kill myself. I'm wondering if it would be ok to try to get some other coping skills out of counseling before I tell her I'm having suicidal thoughts. I'm honestly just scared of what will happen if I do tell her, and I'm scared of  what will happen if I don't."	sw
"Picked a date, struggling to even make it that far. I'm 22. Grad student, first year and fresh-smack-dab out of undergrad in a city I don't know with people I don't know, and everyone I love across state lines and time zones.  Everything is stupid blurry and I feel like time is eroded me, I can't make connections with new people and my old connections are wasted away. I keep thinking ""let me go back to a year ago, when I mattered, when I was someone"" but I'm scared that a year ago I was just as goddamned worthless and stupid as I am now.  I picked a date. A if-it-doesn't-get-better date, a date where I did everything I could and I tried everything (therapy: tried but no dice, social worker: no luck, medical doctor, medicine, everything everything) and I'm so tired. But that day (is it a week away, almost) seems so far away and I don't even want that sunset coming above the horizon.  I'm cold and I can't eat and I hardly sleep and everything is so worthless and I'm so worthless and everyone is gone, sick of me, friends left and who am I who am I who am I who am I"	sw
"unrequited love bringing me to suicidal thoughts this is probably going to sound really stupid  so there’s this guy. let’s call him E.  E is my best friend and i’m his best friend. we hang out decently often, and our friendship is honestly the best thing i have.  but...i am also in love with him....it hurts like hell because he’s literally the cutest, nicest, most amazing guy i’ve ever met in my life, and i honestly want to spend the rest of my life with him, and i care about him deeply, but i know for a fact he’ll never feel the same way.  i forgot to mention i’m a male and E is also a male  he’s very accepting when it comes to homosexuality but he’s straight. that’s the problem. i’m in love with my straight best friend.   the fact that i can never be with him literally hurts like no other feeling i’ve ever felt in my life. i just can’t take it. he’s so AMAZING and it just hurts man.   i often find myself thinking about suicide. if i can never be with such a beautiful person as him, then i don’t really see the point in living, because that’s honestly the only thing i want in my life...so i’m already a failure in life. what’s the point of living with all this pain? what’s the point of living if i can never truly be happy with the one person i love?"	sw
"I'm feeling a bit bad due to my major Hey friends, I've been feeling a little sad lately, and I'll try to explain why in as little writing as possible.  tl;dr- I feel bad my major doesn't help people.  I'm an upcoming sophomore in college and was planning on majoring in chemistry, though now I'm leaning toward applied mathematics. My college is right next to a pretty big hospital and nursing school, so I'll always here and see ambulances and nurses around.  I feel like every time I see one, I start doubting my career path. I feel bad because those people are saving lives and working in often tough and brutal situations while I'm sitting down rearranging numbers on a piece of paper.  It's not about the money, I just feel like I could be helping people. I feel like a bad person for not choosing a more philanthropic career path, like I'm responsible for the people I will now not be helping.  Have any of you felt this? I really hope I'm not alone. I'm sorry if this is a bit too serious, I'm just looking for a bit of guidance. Thank you so much for reading."	cc
"Random woman helped me get to college I'm going to college next year, and was invited to an open house to get a look at the college I'll be attending. Only problem was that I didn't know how to get there. That didn't matter though, because I ran into a woman who was going to the open house as well, and she guided me there. When the time came to leave, I realized I didn't know the way back, and thought I was screwed, but lo and behold, the woman from earlier was back, and she guided me home. She was a cool person to. We had a good talk about our futures, and what exactly we wanted to do. So random woman. Let's meet again someday."	cc
I finally have an opportunity I wanted to kill myself a few weeks ago but the cops were called and my parents have kept a close watch on me since. But tomorrow I finally will be home alone for a few hours. I guess I just felt like I needed to tell someone. Thanks for listening. I’m sorry.	sw
"I'm resenting my kids because they mean I can't kill myself. I have two kids. The youngest is two. That means I have sixteen years. Sixteen years of torture before I can finally just die. I have agoraphobia. I have anxiety and anxiety gives me seizures. I have arthritis in both legs. I can't hold a job. I can't drive a car. I can't go to uni. All I can do is suffer, all day, every day, like I have for the last twenty years.  I'm so tired of pain. I'm so tired of being miserable. All that's keeping me here is the fact that I have responsibility but now I'm starting to resent them just for existing, because while they exist I have to as well.  I just want to die. Is that so much to ask? Just to end forever? What is there even to live for? To be shit on by a crumbling society clinging to a dying planet? To be tormented by the fact that I am a broken, wretched waste of a human being? I'm so tired of this. I just keep telling myself that one day they'll be old enough and I can die without guilt. I just wish it was today."	sw
"I don't want to live anymore. Can't find a well pay job two years after college and a lot of bad things happened leading up to graduation. I have nothing to live for. Does anyone feel this way? Life's been pretty shitty. On the surface my life looks picture perfect and people might be jealous. In reality I'm miserable.  I use EDM and running to distract myself, but I can't run 24/7.   My teeth are in pain and I have multiple cavities. Guys don't like me.  I used to having a high paying internship and haven't been able to find a well paying job. Companies don't want to interview me out of state and I'm unqualified where I live.  I don't want to live anymore.

"Where do you find hope? #AnotherDepressedStudent Where do you find hope? I can’t think of a good reason to live, but can’t talk myself into death either. Instead, every day death and heartbreak swallow my soul a little, suffocating me into a homebound life that’s not very far from death, or at least not living. I’m barely functional and haven’t been for years. I’m not sure I could actually work the full-time job I need to find to survive. I can’t seem to find one more classic to get my college degree. I keep telling myself that there are things to look forward to in life, but I can’t find anything more to look forward to. I don’t get any more family memories, my siblings and grandparents are dead. The rest of the family is lucky to see each other every few years or less. I don’t believe I can ever get my college degree. I’m not sure I can even get a fucking job, let alone have a decent career. My head is hell and my health is shit, so I”m not sure I could have a baby, let alone raise a child of my own. I think I”m destined for lifelong familyness, not having a family ever again.  I basically have no religion anymore, I don’t think I believe in a God or eternity though I did as a kid. My childhood family was extremely religious, so I feel alone in my agnostic views. I don’t get to see my dead siblings or grandparents ever again, and coming to that realization this year is crushing. I’m feeling the loss of all my grandparents, aunts/uncles, 2 siblings, and friends who have died over the years now that I think I’ll never see them again for all of eternity. I don’t have much family to speak off, haven’t seen one relative in over a year... we’re just not close. No siblings (that are still alive). No close family or even nearby family, they’re all 1000+ miles away. I can’t affrod travel or to relocate. I can’t find a fucking job here either. I can’t graduate college no matter how hard I try. I’m running out of time to have babies, but I haven’t found anyone I want to spend life with. I don’t date. I don’t/can’t drive. I”m insecure and feel unloveable, like no one would want to marry me anyway. I’m on the autism spectrum, and I have one friend. One. I can’t afford to Uber/Lyft to go places, so I can’t “go make new friends.” I can’t physically drive. My city is very surburban and very spread out, there’s no bus and it’s not walkable. I can’t afford to move anywhere. I don’t have health insurance so I can’t get treatment again for depression, anxiety, ADD, OCD, etc.   I am, was, a college student. I just graduated a certificate program at one school this semester, but lack my bachelor’s degree from my old tier 1 school by one class. One fucking class that I can’t do. So I have no idea. I can’t find a job where I live, partly because I can’t drive. (My eyesight sucks, austism spectrum, blah blah.) There’s no public transit. I can’t afford to move to a more urban area without a job. I don’t have a family. I’ve maxed out my credit cards, on top of defauling on $200,000 worth of private student loans (yeah, I know I know... I had plans to go to law school for patent law, and could’ve easily paid those back had I not flunked out.)  I haven’t had a steady full-time job in the better part of a decade, mostly taking random shit classes at random schools here and there.   I stay up all night, and sleep the day away because I dread every second of my life. I don’t want to go to sleep every night, fearing each next day more than the previous one, wondering what else is going to break my heart or if I’ll choose to be fucking done with life itself."	sw
I just can't anymore With any of it. I can't stand myself. I can't stand to be in my own thoughts and body. I'm just not normal no matter how hard I try to be. The only time I feel like a real person that can genuinely connect to other people is if I'm on something. I can't keep faking it. I'm so fucking tired of faking it. The thought of spending another weekend alone and in my head is too much to bear. I need to just do it already but don't know how.  Don't tell me it'll get better. I've been waiting my whole life for it to get better and it's just gotten worse. There's nothing left for me here. I've tried it all and nothing works. Nothing. Can. Fix. Me. 	sw

Not sure what I should be doing. Just that this isn’t what I should be doing. The future: Nothing to live for. Failure. No hope. Nothing. Frightening."	sw

"I'm puzzled by how busy parents spend time with their family Sure your dad (or mom) won't be home until the day is over. Apart from that and weekends/off days, when do busy parents find the opportunity to be with their family? Does the provider of the family sacrifice family time for work or do they find a way? Also, if someone is very busy with their jobs, should they get married? I mean, what about their partner and maybe children at home?  It's such a difficult concept for me to understand as my parents divorced while I was very young and my mom is constantly busy at work. Thinking about that always makes me look at parents with awe and how they work hard for their family."	cc

"I think about killing myself every morning I wake up, and I'm constantly thinking about ways to do it through the day I'm 20 years old. Diagnosed schizoaffective along with major depressive disorder that either shows itself as mania or reclusiveness. I was admitted to an inpatient psychiatric facility for 9 days when I was 15 for suicide watch, as well as uncontrollable tactile and audio hallucinations. I'm a poly substance abuser, I will take anything that anyone gives me or that I can get my hands on no matter the situation, time or place. My binges along with the recent doubling of the dose of my antipsychotic have caused me to drop two of my classes because I've slept through alarms no matter what I've tried and still feel tired all day.   I took lsd the first time a month before my 19th birthday which was about two years ago. Since then, without exaggeration have dosed myself once for 9 days straight doubling the dose each day. I have taken acid over 150 times in the span of about a year in a half. The thing is it is the one substance that makes my depression and manic thought silenced and allows me to experience and love life like when it was better. It reminds me of being like 9 years old again.   I can't go a day without using drugs because it seems that that's the only control that I have over my emotions. Take stimulants to stay awake, benzos and booze to forget pain, opiates to feel happy. Everything I guess.   My schizoaffective disorder causes me to be baffled and confused about human normality and makes my emotions intense in every way. My ex cheated on me for months until I found out and the worst part is I have class with her twice a week because we signed up together before everything happened. The hardest part of my week is going into that class and trying not to cry and act civil even though I wish she'd just leave me alone.   I hate who I've become, I hate that I can barely seem to control my life and can hardly make it to work to pay the bills let alone take care of myself or make it to class without wanting to scream FUCK EVERYBODY IN HERE. I am so depersonalized that sometimes I have no sense of self. I would rather be admitted to the hospital forever sometimes because at least there I have a regime I can handle.   I don't self harm in the traditional way but try to get as trashed as possible with any substance, that's like my form of self harm. Like slamming a pint of vodka in one gulp and then lay comatose crying in my bed.   Anyway I hope that wasn't too much text. Mental health services suck where I'm at and it often takes months to become a patient at a outpatient facility and care, and I have Medicaid so I have very limited options. Working on getting some help though.  Thank you.    "	sw

"Pulling myself out of depression, but can't figure out practical steps to take to meet the goals I've finally set. Can anyone help me sort through this? I've been battling a deep depression for several years now. It has sapped my energy and zest for life. I found myself watching TV, playing video games, not working, and not doing much else. I'm tired of living this way and have been implementing small changes (like a morning routine and mindfulness) to try and break out of this toxic rut I've been in. Now that I'm pulling myself out of this deep pit, I'm looking at what positive changes I can make in my life to find more satisfaction.  I know to some degree what things make me happy and what kind of life sounds ideal to me after a lot of time thinking about it, but for some reason, I have **no idea** how to take practical steps to make these things a reality. It sounds so simple; just look at the list, think of some steps to reach those goals, and then do them. But I feel paralyzed. That's where this post comes in. I'm hoping others can help me to see what tangible steps I can take to get me to a life I'd desire.  Here are the things I want and enjoy:  - I am a singer and my dream life involves going to lots of concerts, festivals, and potentially performing at venues (though I'm incredibly shy and uncomfortable with the performance aspect). Heaven to me is being at a concert.  - I am a shy extrovert, so I would like to put myself in a position to be more social and to build more fulfilling relationships.  - I don't prefer being indoors or at home. All of my favorite activities involve being outdoors in a laid-back, casual setting like a bonfire, a concert, a bbq, etc. I don't really know how to create these environments for myself though, especially when I've been as lazy and socially anxious as I have been lately. I'm pretty isolated and don't have a lot of friends at the moment. Plus I'm scared to host events because I am so worried about people enjoying themselves or thinking I'm weird/boring/etc.  - I want to start preparing meals. I enjoy cooking but I tend to see it as a chore, especially when I know I could be doing something more immediately stimulating like watching a show or playing a game.  - I want to learn to be grateful. I've found that a lot of my unhappiness boils down to a constant state of comparison that eats at my self-esteem. I am always looking for a way to be ""happier"" or ""better,"" which serves me well in some cases, but ultimately can be a big problem when it comes to enjoying where I am already.  - I want to learn to handle the physiological feelings I get when I have a negative thought or emotion. Usually, I can handle the thoughts themselves, but the sensations in my body overwhelm me and result in panic.  - I want to be kinder and warmer to my fiance; to treat him as my teammate instead of an enemy when I'm feeling bad, to respect him, and to enjoy my time with him.  - I'd like to start exercising to take better care of my body when it comes to health, but I absolutely hate doing it. Have always hated physical exercise for some reason, even in elementary school. Practically failed gym class, lol.  - I'd like to take care of myself when it comes to how I look. One big thing I've given up on is doing my hair and makeup, but not doing it has made me feel pretty bad about myself.  - And last but not least, I'd like to start seeing the world as a positive place again. I'd like to learn to trust myself, other people, and ultimately God again and to see things through a less cynical and pessimistic light.  So as you can see, I have some goals, but they're all pretty **large and vague**. I don't know how exactly to implement them. I also struggle with attention issues and executive functioning, which makes it difficult for me to stick to a schedule.  **TL;DR** I am pulling myself out of depression. Above is a vague list of my goals, but I am having a hard time finding ways to actually implement them in my real life. Can you help me figure out steps to make these goals a reality?"	cc
"Being just a place holder at work - how to deal? So I started this new job in June last year. I was very excited since it is with a bigger company (20-times more employees than in the job before) and I was promised some major tasks. But from my first day onwards somehow everything went wrong. It wasn't clear in my department what my tasks should be, so I discussed it again with my superior and we came to a common solution. During the next 4 weeks I was busy with trainings (which I had to organise by myself) and afterwards I just sat around. There was a lot of restructuring going on in my and other departments and somehow I slipped through the grid. Since January I have a new supervisor in this new organisational structure and I should work. But I'm so used to not being seen and not working that I'm just a place holder in this office chair.  I can't seem to get back into a working routine and am very nervous that very soon people will notice and I will be getting fired.   Has anyone else ever experienced such a long time of not being required to work because nobody knew what to do with you? And how did you switch out of it again? I know this might sound like a situation many people dream about - not working and still getting fully paid. But honestly I feel like getting dumber and dumber every day and my overall selfworth is completely crushed. So if anyone has similar experiences, please share."	cc
"Im contemplating suicide I have this vicious cycle of destroying absolutely everything in my path. It's not completely my fault, I was born fucked up. My parents adopted me when I was 3 and I had a lot of issues. I never really was able to bond with my adoptive mom after being diagnosed with Reactive Attachment Disorder. I'm also bipolar af. Been hospitalized 3x because I'm crazy. Me and my mom created this never-ending cycle of retaliating against each other. Eventually after fucking up so bad I got kicked out and was sent to a group home. I have destroyed everything for as long as I can remember. I ruined every relationship with everyone in my family. My ex dumped me 2 years ago because I was a fucking mess. After that I went crazy and got super fucked at this party and ended up getting raped. I haven't told anyone. I am now dating a super great guy and have a good job and go to school but despite that I'm still fucking miserable. I have built myself a house of cards and I'm just waiting for an inevitable catastrophe (me) to go and fuck it all up like always. I am sick and tired of trying over and over again. I am just so drained physically and emotionally and I just want to make it all stop."	sw
"I can't do this anymore I can't fucking do this anymore. I've been depressed since I could remember and I want to end it I can't do it. My childhood was shit and I'm still fucked up over it, I'm married but I can't provide for my husband when I'm like this-- he deserves better. Im a lazy shit head and no matter how hard I try im back to wanting to end it all. Maybe that's what I should have done all along. I was going to drink myself into oblivion tomorrow and take the entirety of the pain killers I have. I was never worth it, my family knows it, my husband knows I'm broken beyond repair. I just want this pain to end, these thoughts to be silence. Permanent silence."	sw
"I came to the realization everything in our world is made by a person just like you and me... ...and there is no stopping you from creating something better. I pretty much just got berated in an email exchange while inquiring about a job. Yesterday, i approached a group of people (i knew a girl in the group who i liked), they were most certainly not friendly to my clumsy approach. Overheard them talking shit about me later on. Long ago, that would have bothered me hugely. I would have questioned all of my relationships with people and doubted my social skills or picked out some flaw in myself to obsess over. Now... i just don't care. I took a chance to do something, some people laughed at me. Well shit, i'm still alive. That was fun, felt a bit of adrenaline. Being talked about is better than not being talked about.  Who says you can't be driven, ambitious, confident or smart? You might have gaps in your experience or knowledge of something but nobody was born a damn genius. As far as i'm concerned, having a negative perception of your abilities, what you cannot do is only going to reinforce the belief you cannot do that thing and stop you from practicing to improve. Innate talent is a bullshit abstraction created by mainstream society and media to make you feel worthless and bad about yourself.   So what if you fail?  I suppose it's more about the journey and the experiences that your ventures give you. You as a person are worth more than material possessions or arbitrary status. Frankly, everybody is going to die tbh  Why not do something crazy? Scared of roller-coasters? I'll be damned if that stops me. Go to a theme park right now, find the most thrilling unbelievably scary coaster and ride that bastard 30 times in a row.  You don't exist to impress somebody else. Not your parents, not your closest friends, not your partner. You're not a failure at life, until you call yourself a failure YOLO "	cc
"Help me please. I'm a 20 year old man from the Netherlands, who is turning 21 in a few days. I've been dealing with depression for about 7 or 8 years now.  When I was a teen, my mother did not know how to deal with me because I used to be very hotheaded and hyperactive, which led to her and me having daily arguments. My father was almost always working, so he wasn't often there for me, and if he was home, he didn't want anything to do with his kids. My sister is a person I have trouble being around. She berates me for a whole lot of things I have very little control over (I'll state why later).  When my parents divorced, I quickly started to blame myself over it because I always fought with my mother and felt that I ruined their marriage. I was quickly starting to fail my last year in elementary school and ended up scoring way lower than the teachers expected me to score. Middle school was even worse as I quickly before the person to bully by my class and by a few others which only helped to destroy my already damaged self-esteem and self-worth.  By the time I was in middle school, my mother had a new husband, who was a very abusive person, both verbally and physically. He is now out of my life luckily, but he gave my mother permanent hand damage, he gave my sister a scar on her leg, and he damaged my shoulder and upper back. Whenever I wasn't fighting with my mother or step-father, they were fighting with each other.  I had to go to my father's every two weekends, and half the time during holidays. The first few times went well, where I actually spend time with him, but that all spiraled down once my step-mother came into the picture. I started to shut myself in because she was someone I had never seen before and I couldn't trust new people easily already. My depression gradually and steadily worsened around that time too, and none of my parental figures knew what to do with me. My mother and step-father argued with me all the time, while my father and step-mother didn't bother to ask me if I wanted to do anything and let me just stay in bed all day long. I even stopped joining them for dinner at one point.  When I turned 16, I was taken out of my home situation and I was put in a clinic so I could learn how to fend for myself (because no one had tried to teach me and I had literally no skills to do anything.) While I was at the clinic, I took a brain scan which revealed something about myself that worsened my self-worth even further: There was something wrong with my brain. For whatever reason, my brain is always overactive and takes up a whole lot of my energy, kind of like a burn-out. Over my whole life I got berated by literally almost everyone as lazy when it was actually a medical issue.  Fast forward some time and I was in court as a 17 year old because I originally wanted to remove any form of parental rights over my father because he didn't bother to do anything for me (because he didn't know what he could do), but the judge ultimately ruled for the opposite after asking me, which was that he was forced to seek contact with me.  Around that time, I learned that I am bisexual with a heavy preference for men, which I confided in my mother with her promising to not tell anyone. I quickly learned that that was the wrong choice, as not even after a week, everyone on my mother's side of the family knew about it. My sister literally wanted to cut off all contact with me for being lgbt, which she only didn't because her boyfriend told her to stop being so stupid.  This resulted in spiraling even further down into my self-loathing, and completely destroying my self-confidence and self-worth, and I was put on antidepressants. However, I was quickly taken off of them after telling them I started to see mental images of very gory self-mutilation.  When I turned 18, I was discharged from the clinic and now I live supervised in a home with 3 other people. My father had stopped contacting me completely the moment I turned 18, and by then my mother divorced her second husband. Fast forward 2 uneventful years of me trying desperately to get out of bed in the morning.  My grandmother on my father's side died, which resulted in me and my sister both regaining contact with our father. The contact between him and me is alright now, and I've stayed at his home for new years a few months back. The relationship with my mother is now okay again, and we don't fight as much anymore. However, that's pretty much all the good news that has happened.  My sister and I still barely have any contact, my mother and I barely have any contact, and even though my father and I are on good terms again, the contact is sparse. Financially I'm having trouble almost every month, as because of my brain problem, I'm unable to work, and I'm not eligible for a disability check, because ""I have worked in the past so I should be able to hold a job"", and now that I'm turning 21 in a few days, my alimony has stopped as well. I'm having more trouble than ever to try to get out of bed and go to bed at a reasonable time. I was put on a different brand of antidepressants, but I couldn't bother taking them anymore because they simply didn't do anything. I have one person on this world that I am able to really trust, and he lives on the different side of the earth.  I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm unable to allow people close to me and when they do, I mask my feelings without even thinking about it. I don't feel like I have a purpose to be alive on this world. I don't know if people say they care about me if they really mean it. I feel alone, abandoned, with no hope left. People tell me to ""look for a hobby to occupy yourself with"" but even that's out of reach for me when I get tired after doing groceries at a store 10 minutes away from my home.  I've ended my time with my psychologist because eventually she started berating me and telling me ""you need to start finding something to do during the day"" and ""you need to start working on a sleep schedule"" as if I don't understand that, and the professional therapist I would've gotten literally said the following works to me. ""You cannot be depressed because you said it with a smile"".  I think that I have no purpose on this earth and I'm beyond help. I've been tethering on the edge of ending it and be done with it for everyone's sake, or cling to the (almost) fake hope that someone will find me, pick me up and help me through my problems."	sw

"only slightly disgusted with myself I can't sleep at all lately so I just stay up and eat junk food. I eat healthy during the day and exercise, but then at night I can't sleep and start raiding the kitchen. It's not a lot, but I really should break this habit. New medication I'm taking makes me hungry, pretty much everyone gains weight on it. I'm very concerned about it, especially since I'm now on 2 meds that cause hunger, but the medication is helping a lot with my mental state, so I guess I gotta take the bad with the good...  I wish I could just sleep instead, though. Just press a button and sleep for 10 hours. Anyone else get into a habit of late night snacking? How the heck am I going to keep from gaining weight if I'm always hungry? Going to be tough. Staying fit is hard enough as-is without hunger-inducing medications."	cc
"There's a wolf spider in my room. I don't know where it is now. It's almost 2 AM and I can't find it (; _ ;).   I was working on my computer when my cat ran under my desk. Thought she was high on her catnip or something. The longer I watched her switch back and forth between the sides (there's a platform with my desk just above the floor), the more I thought it was a cockroach (something I loathed as much).   Well, something went near the boxes I've yet to put away (oh, how I'm going to HATE cleaning it now). My cat, Monsoon, was sniffing quite a bit in the corner. That was when I went to get a hardcover book, preparing for the worst. Oh, I thought it was a cockroach all right. I shined my phone light where it was likely to come out. My room's pretty small so I had to be quick before it reaches under my bed.  But no....  What came around? Well, first I heard it. It was crawling out all right. Slow and steady. I was ready. Then I heard the orange bag that was on my floor begin to make creasing sounds. Like something...heavy. I saw it, right then. He was a big one all right. But oh no, not a cockroach...a freaking wolf spider. I could only mouth what the heck before Monsoon made a dash for it.   It KNEW what was going to happen. Never did I actually encounter a wolf spider in my room before and it was HUGE. Just scurried off as Monsoon tried pawing after it (she doesn't go under the bed, of course. Lazy cat.). I about wigged out yelling at Monsoon, ""Kill it!"". Stood on a chair and everything to make me feel ok. Then my Aunt came in to help, tried to take it out with a shoe at one point, to which it jumped about a foot in the air, making us scurry out of our room. Apparently she didnt mind them but I might have freaked her out a little. I get fearfully excitable if that makes sense. Because I was so busy running out of the danger zone, I don't know where it's at now. We looked in the closet. We looked under my bed and all things to look under. I'm not planning on searching for it in my laundry basket anytime soon.   It's been 4 hours now. I now believe I have a full on arachnophobia issue. I freak out at the very sight of it.  Do I just let it be? I especially don't want it climbing my bed. This is the worst hide-and-seek with a spider I ever had, and I'm not having fun one bit. I even have most of my family history in boxes too...all fit in my closet...  I apologize in advance for the text (on mobile) and if this is probably not the right sub. I guess I'm on here to find at least some sort of comfort in a conversation. I'm probably going to say screw it with my sleep at this point. I don't know. What would you realistically do in this situation?  On a lighter note, how are you all? It's quite nice out here tonight. "	cc

"There's no light for hope What do I say? My life is the worst? It's not. I'm a mid 30s male and there's so much in this world to experience. At least that's what people tell me. I grew up in a very small town (less than 1000) where both my parents grew up as well. I was active in church, I played in pep band, and was the resident geek as I somehow had a brain to grasp computers. After high school I tried college for the next 7 years. In and out to the point I finally got an associates degree. Big whoop. Doesn't do anything for me and haven't had a job in the tech field for over 8 years.  Eventually I was requainted with a girl from our hometown at some mutual friends' wedding. 3 years later we married. That was over 4 years ago. I struggled with alcoholism until about 10 months ago when I just realized I didn't want that for our future life together and simply stopped. It was great! It finally seemed life was going to be what we wanted it to be...  Her brother had gotten me a great job with lots of room for advancement. I was well liked and stood out among the workforce. I was well on my way to moving up. We lived in a big house with a couple roommates. Both we had known for a long time and we all got along great. The last I remember speaking about our future was mid to end of November. How we were going to work on having children this coming year, find a place of our own, and even buy a 2nd car. 2018 was looking to be a wonderful year. Then came the week before Christmas.  The Sunday before Christmas, while she rode the bus to work, she text me saying didn't want to be married anymore. The next few months cut my very core out. She started staying with a trans male coworker (intimately as well), got on dating sites, and even tried to fuck a coworker in the basement below our bedroom one night before I told him he needed to leave.  Emotionally distraught, my performance at work began to suffer. The owners, supervisors, and coworkers alike all tried to help the best they could, but in the end, as gracious as they were, I had to be let go. The lease was soon up on the house and everyone had moved out. The roommates helped me the best they could, but I soon had to move in with a cousin a couple hrs away.  In the weeks that followed, a severe, dibilitating pain I had experienced once before came back and hasn't gone away for weeks. I've had multiple tests and am waiting on the results of the last round. And just the other day I was informed my wife had taken me off her insurance. So, here I sit: pain that barely let's me get about most days, completely broke, and no source of income. My wife is having a blast living the single life while I sit here being a burden on the people around me.  Why go on? I'm already in my 30s with no love interest. I'm already a few years older than my dad was when I was born. I seriously doubt children are in my future now. I'm not drinking anymore. Why is all this happening? Just when I thought life was beginning to take off, it completely and utterly came crashing down around me. This would all make sense if I was still actively drinking and being a shit head.  My world view is so bitter now. I was that overly optimistic guy you know who can for some weird reason always see the bright side of any situation. Not anymore. I see married couples and just think how long till you guys quit each other? Jr/Sr high students all looking at a bright future I just want to grab and say what are you so happy for? Life is shitty no matter what you do! I don't even have the strength to be selfish with my things and have simply been giving away whatever I can. Not even selling them. Just giving away precious things. Heirlooms I wanted to give my children someday. If it weren't for the instinctual motivation that being ""hangry"" gives us, I would simply stop eating. I just want to be done. My dreams have died turning my heart cold and my outlook on life bleak.  So that's my life now: waiting for the end of this cold tunnel with no light for hope.  P.S. She never did give me a reason why she didn't want to be married anymore. "	sw

"Watching myself throw my life down the drain. I am currently laying on my bed before I go to work tonight at my dead end, stress inducing restaurant job. It’s what I do every day, I lay here, smoke weed,or play video games until I force myself to  get up and get ready for work.  I am completely lethargic, I can’t bring myself to get out of bed some days. I worry my mother, who I live with again, because she will come home from work at 4 in the afternoon and I will be laying in my bed, sulking or doing absolutely nothing.   I started taking antidepressants for my anxiety and depression about 4 1/2 months ago, and for the first 3 months, they worked like a charm. Still, I’m almost completely relieved of my anxiety, but my depression has worsened.  I wouldn’t kill myself, but I have been putting myself into positions to make myself think there is no other way out.  For example, My car broke down a month ago in front of some random lady’s house, it’s still sitting there. Even though it’s most likely a belt or pump problem, I just can’t bring myself to fix it. I don’t want to have transportation, I want my life to go down the drain until I have no other choice but to end it myself.   I want to get better, I really do. I want to be able to enjoy my life and see a reason to keep going, but I just can’t. "	sw

"I cannot fathom the love my mom has for me. This past weekend, I went home and my mom paid $2k off my debts. I saw one of her accounts, and she had around $2.4k. Instead of just paying in the hundreds or half and keep most to herself, she paid all $2k and now has around $400. I know my mom doesn’t have a lot of money on her. She even told me I have more than her as a college student. I looked at her other accounts and they were all in the low hundreds.   This unfathomable act of compassion, love, and kindness from my mom really hit me because even I wouldn’t do that to myself. I can’t even begin to comprehend it.

"Really need a reason not to do it I've been fighting an uphill battle against what I can't see as anything other than hopeless circumstances and the despair is winning. I'm disabled. I've tried to reenter the work force 3 separate times over the course of the last 5 years and each time has ended in a disaster for my health. I get so sick and do so much damage to myself trying to work that I get to the point I just physically can't anymore. I'm applying for disability but even if I get it it will be well below the poverty line and not something I can sustainably live off of.  I've made it through these past 5 years because my at-the-time husband was picking up the slack as I tried to recover my health but he left me. I had to rush back into the workforce despite my health not having been recovered enough for that. I did it for much longer than I thought I could because I had to to survive but now the damage has been done and I find myself unable to work again with no one to help me survive as I try to recover. I don't have family or much in the way of friends, certainly not any that would be willing or able to provide for me while I can't do it for myself. I don't know what to do.  I don't see a way out of this. I'm not capable of supporting myself and I have no one I can rely on. I'm utilizing every resource available as far as assistance goes but there just isn't much. Housing assistance has a waiting list to get on the waiting list, both if which are estimated to be a year long so there is no reasonable expectation of help in that regard and I don't qualify for Medicaid because in my state you must be either pregnant, a single mom, receiving disability payments, or elderly to qualify so I have no insurance and my medical bills keep climbing. I'm buried under inescapable debt. I see no way out of these things.  I don't want to be homeless. I don't want to have to worry every day where my next few meals are coming from. I don't want to live in my busted car. But maybe even more than all that I just don't want to have no one anymore. I'm so alone.   I have a plan and the means. I'm just hoping I can find a reason not to do it before everything becomes too much. Living under this constant stress of fear of basic survival needs not being met is destroying and semblance of sanity I had left. I've been strong for so long. Is it really so bad if for once in my life I'm just...not? Is it really so bad to call it quits when no one needs me?"	sw

I was active and full of energy. I think that from when i started middle school, my life went really downhill. I started loosing interest in everything i liked, i started to not enjoy the things i used to enjoy so much. Sometimes i would just start to cry for no goddamn reason (i still do, by the way) and now that i'm in high school, i really feel like shit. I could never do something productive with my life and i know that. The reason i haven't killed myself yet is because of my own lazyness and because of my parents that i love more than anything in my life, and it would absolutely destroy me to see them sad, but now i'm starting to loose interest in that as well. I know people go trough much worse but i really needed to talk about this (or, well, write about this). Thanks and sorry for wasting your time  Sorry for typos"	sw

Even if I die Of natural causes it could be framed as something else! My goal in life is to be diagnosed with the brain disease I have that was neglected since I was 16. But after a big argument with my family over it I realized they will try their hardest to do anything to cover it up if I ever get in a vegetative state they could say it’s Catatonia if I die from the brain disease they will still ignore my claims of a brain disease and make something up about it and that is probably all that will happen even with a postmortem biopsy.	sw

"Tarot cards for psychology Interestingly enough, I was reading up on tarot cards and the history of them, first as playing cards, divination/spirit communication (whatever you want to call it) came later.   I think many people who do psychic readings just do it for the money; if you actually think you’re talking to spirits, well, you have another thing coming, but whatever floats your boat.   Anyway, I read that some therapists use them sort of like a Rorschach test, providing a different perspective of seeing a problem, both figuratively and physically in the image.   Granted, things only have power if you give it power, but I still think it’s an interesting idea. "	cc

"A few thoughts before I test hanging myself My wife will be gone from the house for a couple hours on Friday. I'm going to test hanging myself (with the easiest, cheapest way of doing that possible, to leave the exact method vague). I'll try to not kill myself right away, but it's fine if it happens. I'll leave a note on the stairs before I try it warning my wife not to come upstairs.  I feel at ease as I think about what's led me here. I don't enjoy anything anymore: hobbies, home life, vacation, it's all anxiety-inducing or cripplingly dull. Work sucks and I feel stuck in a field I didn't even study for, and I'm not even 30 yet. My wife has zero libido and I'm so fucking sad that we share basically no intimacy. I tried to rebuild my social life after neglecting it for years, but it hasn't worked. I don't do anything in my life that benefits anyone else. All I do is consume and take up space.  Medication barely helps. The ""counselor"" I got referred to likes to hear himself talk more than me. I can't even live in a good state where I could just use weed to cope.   Things could get better, but having to stick around just for the chance of that happening isn't worth it. To exist in such a state of misery is worse than nonexistence. My dogs have helped me not kill myself for this long, but I didn't socialize them well so I basically fucked up their lives. Maybe someone else can be the better human they deserve."	sw

"I’ve decided I’m gonna kill myself tonight. I’ve made my plan on how and when. Now just biding time and decide to search the Internet and found this. So I thought it would feel nice to at least let someone know that I will be dead by tomorrow morning. I don’t have much to say though. I guess I should start with why, well this past week has been tough. I lost my home and job. Living in my ride was not all that bad and I had it better than most. I have had this feeling for years of just wanting to die and thought of Suicide and even attempted it but failed, that was six to seven years ago. I thought since I didn’t die like I wanted and having my family look at me like I am an embarrassment made me feel anguished but I figured there was worry in there somewhere so I decided to struggle for a bit longer hoping for a meaning to my existence. Unfortunately I found nothing and things are pretty bad now, this past week I’ve thought of nothing but killing myself. I’m tired of pretending I care when I’m just a selfish, worthless, pathetic excuse of a human being. I’ve did nothing but burden my family and I’m tired of bothering them with this hopelessness I carry with me. Death will be my salvation and I can finally rest from this life I’ve never wanted nor deserved. I’m not afraid of what’s to come as a matter of fact I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I’m prepared. Whoever reads this post is probably the only people I’ve told of my feelings and thanks for reading. I still have several hours before I go through with it so feel free to reply. I’ve got time."	sw

"How IRL Streamer, Ice Poseidon helped me go through Depression. last year I was pretty suicidal and most of the thoughts I had was about how I wanna kill myself, I had a girlfriend at the time aswell so I was happy from time to time but this summer she left me and that’s when I started cutting myself. I could not take the pain mentally so I had to make myself feel the pain physically to atleast let it out. Throughout the rest of the year, all my thoughts were about killing myself. And then the beginning of the year, I saw a video and it had Ice Poseidon included in it, I don’t remember exactly what it was but he caught my attention. After a few vids, I saw the video of him where he cried on stream and expressed how he truly feels and god damn I have never felt connected to someone. I related to the fact that his relationship with his parents weren’t the best and he couldn’t talk to them how he feels. A video online never hit me so hard and so close to home. Ever since then, I’ve been watching his VODS and recently just started watching actual livestreams. Ever since I started watching him, not a single thought about killing myself have crossed my mind. I just wanted to say, Mr. Paul Denino, thank you for helping me go through this and for saving my life. lets have a moment of silence and Cx in the chat/comments."	sw
"I have to believe that one day I will be rewarded for the good I have done/will do. I have to believe that the hurt & misfortune I go through has a purpose.I have to believe these things in order to make it to the next day.I have to believe that one day everything will be okay. But will it? I keep trying and trying and trying. Nothing is good enough. I wake up each day and try so hard to be better. I try to have a positive outlook on life. I try to be the light in the lives of others. I always go out of my way to help someone or text them or do something to make them smile. But it is never returned. If I don’t text someone first, then we don’t talk. No one ever calls or texts or asks how I’m doing. Because nobody cares. I’ve put on this happiness facade for so so long that I think people just think I’m always okay. They think I could never feel so low that I cry myself to sleep. Or cut myself or contemplate just ending it all. They don’t know that my anxiety has gotten so bad that I can’t control my crying or panic attack’s.  And those who do know, do not care.I used to be able to remain silent when being yelled at or look past why was being said. Now I can’t even do that. My instant reaction is to just break. I’ve bottled everything up for so fucking long that everything is the tip of the iceberg. Everything just piles on top of each other. And I just let go by crying. Because when I do try to explain why I feel the way I do I’m wrong.  I apologize for being upset with things that are said or done to me but no one apologizes for saying or doing the thing in the first place. I guess it’s just so hard for me to understand how nobody looks out for me because I am so empathetic with everyone and their feelings. If I know you’re going through something, I will try to make your day easier by helping you out and taking some stress off your shoulders. But when is it my turn? When do I get to have someone genuinely care about how I’m feeling? When do I get my thoughts and emotions heard and understood instead of bottling them up or being to blame? When? I have always been in the shadow of those around me who have mental health issues. And because Of it, I’ve never gotten help. Because my issues “aren’t as bad”. I need help so badly. I have considered putting myself into a mental health hospital but I could never afford that. I have looked into going to a counselor but no one is ever open during the hours Im available. Not like I could afford that either. I need help. I want to be better. But it’s so fucking hard when the people around me who have the resources to help themselves, don’t get help. They don’t realize how jealous I am i their opportunities. They have the chance to get help. They choose not to.  Meanwhile I’m struggling so bad wishing I could change. I’ve never felt so low in my life. My anxiety has never been so bad. My self esteem is almost non existent because every time I like something it is put down or made fun of. Every time. I don’t think I can do it anymore. "	sw

"I just can't do this anymore. I know my problems probably seem stupid to most people, but it's too much for me and I'm tired. Exhausted. Waking up every day feels like torture. Every night, I wish that I didn't have to wake up.   I'm 22F, I've been battling depression for three years now. I'm unemployed, I wasted my chance to get a degree from a good university because of my anxiety causing me to have to stop school. I tried going on meds and therapy for over a year, but that didn't help at all. It just made me feel worse.   I hate my family, but I have no choice but to be stuck and dependent on them. Yes, I know that if I just get a job and try to fend for myself and be independent then I could make it. But I can't even get myself off my bed on most days, so that's out of the picture. I'm weak and tired and I know it and I hate myself for it. I hear them talk shit about me all the time, and how terrible of a person I am, and how selfish I am. I end up hating myself even more. My parents are divorced, so I live with my mom and brother. My dad is even worse than them, so there's really no win as to where I could possibly stay.   I ended my engagement six months ago, mainly because I didn't feel that it was fair to be married to someone I didn't truly love. Someone I couldn't truly love. I ended up dating this other guy a month later, which made me feel like I could have a chance at happiness, but he screwed me over so hard. He gave me hope of a dream that I could really want, but after all the promises, he just dropped me. It just made my depression even worse. Waking up feels like I'm drowning, realizing that I've just been given up on again. That I'm completely worthless.   To make it worse, my family (with me) just moved to another country less than a year ago. So I'm stuck here in a new country, with zero friends, no job, and no will to live. I've been dreaming of killing myself for years, but I'm finally at my limit. I'm just trying to find the easiest and fastest way to do it. "	sw

"slipping back into suicidal thoughts I'm not entirely sold on the idea yet, I would have to see just how bad my life is going to get first, but here's my story:  Growing up I didn't have too much to live for. I had a good family at home and grew up in a middle class environment, but that's where the good fortunes kinda ended. Not to belittle how great those are, because had I not had those aspects of my life growing up, I probably would be committed or dead right now. But the rest of the story goes like this: I got bullied a lot until high school. I was fat, eccentric, a bit effeminate, and a minority in a whitewashed town. It started off with targeting me and making me look like a fool, and I tried to kill myself when I was 11 because of it. It got worse over time. I've been called everything from the n-word to insults commonly used against Hispanics and Indians (I'm both), told to go back to my home country, and beat up because of my appearance. I was molested when I was 14 by a school bully who pulled my pants down so that my dick was hanging out, and then the following day proceeded to grope me. It made me really angry and sad, and I was scared to masturbate until I was 18. During and around this time, I started to become really inward and cold towards people, including my family, who I was very hostile and distant towards until I was 18.  Shortly thereafter, I began to figure out how to fit in with the kids that were making my life a living hell. I realized certain aspects of myself had to be pushed away, and certain behaviors had to be toned down or hidden. Interests as well, and I couldn't risk tainting my image by dating a girl who wasn't considered to be acceptable by my peer's standards, otherwise I'd be bullied again. But the girls that were everyone's desires weren't attracted to me, because I wasn't really high up there on the totem pole either looks wise or popularity wise. That didn't bother me, but what did bother me was that if I simply didn't want to get picked on, I had to literally live a life that did not allow me to be fundamentally human. I couldn't express myself at all, I had to monitor who I kept in my circle strictly, and dating was pretty much off the table. As a teenager, that was very destructive for me. I also tried to, and many minorities can relate to this, 'whiten up'. I tried 'acting white', identifying as white (I'm mixed race), and while I was never racist, I was very resentful of my ethnic background, which made me somewhat angry at my mother, who was the reason I was a POC. I had nobody to vent to about these frustrations, as I felt too distant from my parents, too distrusting of my peers, and my closest friends were dealing with far worse issues that I didn't want to burden them with. So I took them out online, being a 'troll' as it were. I made a fake persona that was a loose portrayal of my real life, and my biggest (pretty much my only) target was women, or myself. In my real life, I was respectful, timid, and pretty self-effacing around women, be it family, friends, or girls I was attracted to. But when I would talk with friends, and moreover, when I would talk online, I would absolutely shit on women. Every slur you could think of, mocking them, objectifying them, et al. I did this for three reasons: 1) The guys I wanted to fit in with, who were either bullying me or were friends with bullies, almost always behaved this way. Only one guy I know wasn't like this that was in that group. He was a good dude. 2) Besides being a minority, having 'feminine' interests (writing, art, fashion, music...) got me bullied a lot too. I was also shamed for having crushes to the point where I couldn't even admit to myself that I was attracted to girls. It made me hateful of anything feminine, and considering femininity was initially conceived as a way to stereotype womanhood, I hated women for being feminine. I saw them as my adversaries because what society had attributed to them I thought was inherent of them, and I knew that it made me get bullied. I couldn't stand them because of that. 3) After being molested, I was super insecure and withdrawn about my sexuality. I didn't masturbate, I didn't date, I only really had any remote romantic involvement with one girl in high school and that was just conversational and a meetup once. I hated the fact that I felt sexual attraction to girls, because it made me feel helpless and vulnerable, like the time when I got molested. So I was resentful of those feelings, and lashed out in private about women. Icing on the cake was that I didn't really know what feminism was, so I assumed ignorantly that it was just women blindly hating men. So I would wreak havoc online with insulting women. Never directed at a particular woman, sent to a woman, or about a woman, but just blind insults to women in general. I would piss people off, and I ended up going completely fucking insane with this persona. It became like a Mr. Hyde for me. By day I was mild mannered, quiet, and genuinely decent to people, but all of my insecurities and anger were released into this ugly capsule. I also tried killing myself when I was 17, and the only reason I survived was because I didn't cut myself deep enough. I bled out for 11 minute profusely. I soaked through an entire roll of toilet paper, a gym bag I had, and a few towels. It was absolutely terrifying. I was getting really bad dry mouth towards the end, and I felt like I was going to pass out. Had I not stopped bleeding then, I would have probably needed to go to the hospital. My parents, who had been throwing me in and out of therapy, assuming I had something wrong even though I kept it hidden by being hateful and withdrawn towards them, never found this out. I vehemently denied it, saying my cat scratched me, and eventually they gave up trying to figure it out. I knew that if they found out what I did, I'd be doped up on meds and potentially put away in a mental hospital. I knew I had no chemical imbalances, my surroundings were just driving me insane. I had derealization syndrome, I was having a hard time sleeping, and panic attacks were regular occurrences. I was snapping, but I knew it wasn't a chemical problem. If they started doping me up and locking me away like I was insane, then I would turn insane, and I'd be a victim of my circumstances completely.  And then I went to college.  As I was graduating high school, I made a point of losing weight. I didn't care about my looks, I didn't care about what people said about me (and even when I was in high school and relatively popular, people chimed in about my minority status and weight a lot), I just wanted to get fit. I was ridiculously out of shape, and although I was strong due to working out, you wouldn't know it because I was a slob. I lost a lot of weight, and put a lot of muscle on, around the last month of school was when I had mostly evened out. I lost a little more weight over the summer, and I moved into college.  In high school, I didn't really pay attention to girls. I was very on edge about being at all vulnerable, so I was voluntarily withdrawn from dating. Even when I was fat though, a good amount of girls had found me attractive. Mostly creepy ones who stalked me or obsessed over me, but at least it was something. When I got to college, I had come to terms with that I wasn't a good looking guy. I was just not what women wanted, both as a person and with my looks. I was content with this, accepting of it, and found comfort in it. I set my expectations realistically, and kept to myself. But, apparently, I found out I was actually pretty hot once I got in shape. Girls who I never even fathomed would ever find me attractive were losing their minds over me, dozens of them. I was told I should go into porn once, and I did a modeling shoot with a friend. It was kind of surreal. It also led to me getting sexually assaulted, and meeting a lot of girls who although attracted to me, treated me like crap. I withdrew inward, but my bitterness towards women was declining. I had become more accepted for who I was at college, and the progressive nature towards gender dynamics that colleges can foster made me more comfortable to be myself. I was still really down on myself because of my personality however.  The nail in the coffin for my misogyny, and the beginnings of me losing my self-hatred, was when I took this random class by an exceptional professor that ended up being about racism and sexism. Prior to this class, I had, despite racist insults, convinced myself I was white. I was still pretty iffy about feminism, but I had greatly toned down the outright hatefulness I used to express online, and even sympathized with a good bit of modern feminism. But when I took this class, and saw the facts presented to me about these things, I realized I was never white at all despite being a light-skinned person, and that feminism not only benefited women, but it REALLY benefits men. Especially for a guy like me, who wasn't really a stereotypical male, feminism stood up for guys like me to express themselves, as well as demanding equity for women. I completely dropped being sexist after that, whether online, in real life, or in jest. It was a learning process to unlearn that stuff, but I got there. And slowly but surely, I ended up becoming more comfortable, caring, accepting, and even loving of myself. Appreciative of who I was. Honestly, it was incredible how much getting in shape, actually interacting with women, and learning about women's issues changed my perception of things. I realized just how disgusting sexism was, and how even as a joke, it was really shitty to behave in a sexist way. I wouldn't say I'm a feminist, only because I think I may have waived the ability to be one in the days of my youth, but I absolutely agree with their sentiments.  Fast forward to my senior year. I'm about to wrap it up. Based off of what I previously wrote, you'd think I had a good directional change for my life path, and was ready to start life anew. Well, that didn't happen. I chose a major that I was best suited for, which was communications, specifically advertising. I did well in college, I have internship experience, was involved at school, et cetera. But I realized that the field I'm qualified to work in via this degree raises major ethical concerns for me, particularly regarding privacy. These were concerns I was also unaware of until it was too late into the major track for me to switch, unless I wanted to stay an extra year, which I do not have the economic means for. The corporate environment for advertising is known for its sexism and racism, which I refuse to tolerate at my workspace, but I also will have to be tethered to social media, and be involved with big data collection. Ever since I was in high school I was up to date with the hideous things the American government, and other world governments, do to enforce digital surveillance without or knowledge. I am vehemently against it, and given recent leaks about social media surveillance, stuff I've learned in my advertising classes about it, and the most recent Cambridge Analytica scandal on Facebook, I've withdrawn from social media completely. I haven't been removed from social media in eight years, now I'm completely off. I also refuse to engage in practices, or be a part of a direct process, of obtaining, deciphering, or using big data to construct essentially artificial digital worlds for people via rigged advertising and selective searches. Couple this with demanding, erratic hours, and potentially having to be international at random times at a moment's notice, and the corporate level of what I'm qualified to work in does not look like the job for me. Problem is, the nonprofit sector of what I'm studying pays so little I would be better off working a full-time retail position at or around minimum wage. Elsewhere in comm, I either lack the qualifications to go into it (broadcasting), it is relatively as corrupt (public relations), or the corporate environment and pay is even worse (journalism). So at the moment, and in the foreseeable future, I'm fucked. I'm applying to jobs in New York City, where I attend school, and could probably shack up with a friend (splitting rent and utilities obviously) if I can get a solid blue collar job. But if I don't find that, and that's definitely not a guarantee, I will have to move back home. Networking and job opportunities are scarce, as it is in an outdated little town, and again, the racist bullshit is everywhere. And the sexism. Quite frankly, when I'm there for too long it triggers old feelings of sadness and self-hate. It's not healthy for me to be back there, and if I'm stuck in that town, I may end up being there forever. I'm also single, and the loneliness is getting to me (I've got a decidedly small circle at school, and we're all very busy right now as seniors, so I'm alone a lot. It's hard to fall asleep sometimes because of it). I don't like most of the women where I grew up, and I have little desire to try dating where I'm from. I don't date white women as a personal choice of preservation for my ethnic roots, so it's very hard to find POC women where I'm from, let alone ones who I am compatible with. There's little in the way of socializing, and most of the people where I'm from are considerably older than me. Having no job, or a part time job that I could have gotten in high school, in a hometown that ends up being taxing on my mental health to live in, all alone, and with no change in sight, will definitely not yield positive results for me.  The linchpin for the suicidal desires comes in the form of pursuing a passion of mine. Since I was 10, I rapped. I did it to escape my everyday problems. I quit it upon attempting to kill myself for the last time in high school, and stopped rapping for five years. As my life has been spinning out of control recently due to my impending graduation and bleak outlook, I've gotten back into rapping, and taught myself how to produce. Turns out, the stuff is coming out pretty damn good. A few very small time bloggers have checked it out (who don't know me personally and regularly shit on people who show them music, so they're not sycophants), and my friends and family, and on all fronts I get notably positive reception. There's even, it's incredibly small but it's existent, anticipation for a project I'm going to put out. All well and good, but the problem is my digital past. The insensitive shit I used to say as a kid online. I also aired out some family grievances online, with less than ideal language, and although I've taken measures to delete the stuff, nothing disappears from the Internet, and it will eventually come to light. I also used to say I was white on occasion online, before I really understood my mixed race identity. I never said anything racist online, but I would also look ridiculous talking about racism from a firsthand experience if I claimed I was white, even though I'm not white. My music is about political themes such as this, and people will shit on me and think I'm a walking contradiction once this stuff is exposed. I'll be bounced out of hip-hop, and then I won't be employable, and my family will think less of me, so I'll spin out of control. My entire life will be marred by the things I said in a time of deep hurt, ignorance, and nihilistic rage as a teenager, because although I may grow and change, that past is permanent via the Internet. My one shot to potentially live out a childhood dream and escaping my current situation has effectively been killed. Even if the music never blew up enough for me to make a full-time living off of it, if it blew up at all, and people connected the dots, I'd be exposed, and the damage would be done. My ethics and fear of technocracy have led me away from pursuing a job with my major. I'm left with essentially nothing to live for, and was thrown into this situation partly of my doing, but absolutely as a reaction to my circumstances. I feel completely hopeless, and that all of my personal initiatives to better myself and change my life were pointless. I feel that if I just killed myself years ago, the disappointment that will be my adult life, and the suffocation of most likely spending the rest of my days in my hometown that hates people like me, would have been avoided. As well as the loneliness. If it gets as bad as I think it is going to get upon graduation, by this time next year I will not be alive. "	sw

I’ve never been a server before and was really stressed, but today I had my first shift and was waiting my own tables by myself half way through! I even got a compliment from the district manager!!! Apparently I have a real knack for it and I’m very excited to have this for a second pastime. I was having a really down week before this all, too, so finding this new ability has really boosted me!

"I’m so Bored and Alone Away at college and everyone around me here seems to have tons of friends and I feel like I am the only one without anyone to go to or talk to about anything I am feeling. I got to dinner alone most nights at the dining hall and sit alone while everyone is chatting with friends and significant others. Seeing other groups of people and friends together just makes me even more angry that I don’t have the luxury of having a group of friends myself. I literally sit in my room all day on the weekends and do close to nothing besides go to my classes and get exemplary grades. I have tried dating apps, almost nobody ever swipes right on me and when they do I’m usually ghosted within the week. I’m not sure what to do and I feel extremely powerless and like there is ultimately not much to live for. I’m just a sad pathetic loser."	sw

"Don't really have anyone in my life to share the good news with, so here goes.. I GOT A JOB! For the first time in 2 years I am employed!  I was finishing my degree until just a few months ago, and for most of my time in school I wasn't able to find a job since I lived in an area that was oversaturated with unqualified students looking for hourly work at restaurants and such. Then these past SIX months I've been legitimately too sick to even consider working.. until literally just a few days ago!!  I've been going through very expensive and invasive tests these last few months and we're finally starting to figure out what's wrong with me, and I'm finally on medication that helps. For less than a week now I've been pain free and able to live my life like a normal healthy person, which is already so incredible for me since I'd forgotten what it felt like to feel capable and self reliant.  Just a few days ago I decided to go ahead and apply for a job at a nice restaurant up the street, but I wasn't getting my hopes up since I've gotten so used to being rejected from all the jobs I've applied to these past few years. But just yesterday I was interviewed and officially offered the job, and I start next week!  I haven't been this happy in such a long time that I don't even remember. I'd completely lost faith in myself and now I actually feel OPTIMISTIC for my future, maybe for the first time ever. Which is kind of scary and unfamiliar. I even baked a huge cake today! I'm just so happy to be employed that I start crying when I think about it :')  EDIT: WOW I was gone for Easter and just logged back in, and I am so amazed and grateful at how much positive support I'm getting!! Thank you all so much, I've been going through a tough time lately not having any friends and being sick all the time, and I feel a lot less alone now, as silly as that might sound. You guys are the best :)"	cc
"I don't want to die but I don't know how to live either I'm almost turning 18. That means I will have to pay for my own insurances and bills soon. It's not a problem for normal students, they earn enough by working in a supermarket three days a week. But not me.. I have crippling social anxiety. I have a small job, delivering newspapers all day every day. It's just enough to pay for my insurance.  My parents want me to go find a better job but I'm terrified. I used to work as a help chef in the kitchen for a good restaurant but my social anxiety made me feel like I wasn't worth it and the kitchen staff bullied me so I quit. I tried.. I can't do it. I can't find another job. I can't earn money. I can't afford school.  I feel so guilty, I should have been successful by now, Instead I'm a pathetic loser. I don't want to be a burden to my parents anymore.. So I think I will kill myself on my 18th birthday and do everyone a favor. I have never even accomplished my dreams, but I feel like there's no other way to solve this problem.  Maybe you guys know another solution. Please don't suggest therapy because I can't afford that. Thank you and I'm sorry. "	sw
"I don’t know how to “let go” One of my biggest personal issues is obsessiveness and with simply not being able to let go of pain. I still remember mean things people said to me in high school (I’m 25) and sometimes they can still make me sad, I remember every fight I’ve had with my girlfriend, every word said in anger. I carry it all with me all the time and it’s so exhausting, it’s so upsetting to realize you’re sad about something that happened years or months ago. But I don’t know how to make the thoughts stop, it’s affecting my relationships, I neglect my responsibilities sometimes just to ruminate. I can’t even picture what my life would be like free of this baggage because I can’t even conceptualize what that might look like. How does one learn to “let go”."	cc
"Girlfriend left me because she's depressed, now I'm even more depressed than I was before I met her and it's all piling up So yesterday my now exgf said ""I need to focus on myself"" because of mental health issues she's been struggling with for years. Don't get me wrong I understand that she doesn't want to waste emotional energy on me, she needs to take care of herself first and foremost. But for a good six months, she was a big reason why I didn't start cutting again, or try to kill myself. Now that she's gone, wtf do I do? There's a physical pain I have and I don't know how to deal with it.  I contemplated cutting again, I'm in the process of giving myself a stick n poke tattoo, just doing some outline work on a rising sun.  Definitely contemplated killing myself. My girlfriend left me, my GPA starts with a 1, I'm probably going to be evicted because my job hasn't been giving me enough hours, oh and my best friend has POF and cancer.   All I possibly have to look forward to is a dance show in May, that I've working on for a few months now, and my motorcycle license later this month. Have no money, so it's kind of pointless.  I've been working on being a dickhead to my family so they don't miss me when I'm gone.  There's a ringing in my ears I can't quiet down, and these problems don't have solutions."	sw
whats the point Im not sure Im going to make it all the way through today. Im tired of being a failure and tired of being alone. My only achievements are floating through life on a wave of mediocrity my only friends get sick of me and shut me out of their lives regularly. I cant think of anyone who I could call that wouldnt just end up being annoyed. I have the bullet here and I just keep looking at it and thinking maybe it would just be better to fade away. I dont feel like theres that many paths left in my life that will take me somewhere happier and the probability of finding one of those is small. I just dont know what to do. Im struggling to find a good reason to wake up tomorrow.	sw

"Getting comfy Had a really weird/off mood today. Don't know what happened but I somehow woke up with the wrong leg (I don't know if this works, it's a german saying lol) and it hasn't improved at all.  I learned japanese a little bit, spent some quality family time and did a lot of sport, yet my mood still didn't improve.  Althought my mood is still kind of eh, I now got into my comfy clothes (special occasion comfy - not standard comfy), dimmed the lights, made myself some tea and went to my bed.

It is 12:19 am and I’m in bed deciding how to do it. I ask myself, “Do I overdose on the drugs, I have been stealing from my father?” “Do I get into my car and drive and find a place to crash?” “Do I hang myself?” “Do I drive to a place where I just have to jump?” All of these things come into my mind and I think, “Am I going to do it?” “ Am I going to finally go through with it?” I recall and think back of memories of my sister and my girlfriend, while it is comforting, I find no solace in staying any longer. Will they miss me? Yes, but it’s for the better. I don’t do anything with my life. What have I contributed in society, nothing. I feel worthless. I’m not worth anything. I’m sorry. "	sw

It's like my mental state is crushing, and I don't want to talk to anyone close to me about it because I don't want to burden anyone. So here I am.

"Should I move? Where to? Hello everyone -  I've lived in cold Weather climates all of my life (Chicago, Minneapolis) and as I get older (about to turn 45) winters get really old on me, fast.  As I am typing this, it's now snowing out here in Minneapolis, in April.  The thing is, Minneapolis is a pretty decent city, and I have a good, well-paying job - but I hate the extreme temperatures.  The absolutely frigid winters, and basically anything over 80F (27C) during the summer if there is humidity involved - and there generally is.  Anyone have any recommendations of a reasonable climate which  doesn't get too hot or cold, and has good tech jobs?  Yes, I'd love anything in the Bay Area, Portland, or Seattle, but the price that goes with that would make anything super expensive.  I'd love not to have to drive to work as well, but I can probably only be so picky....  There is ironically some subreddits (/r/WhereShouldIMove and /r/WhereShouldIBe) but they are basically inactive.  Hoping for some lively conversation from people who know cities in the US!  (I'd love to move internationally, but the logistics behind that would be tough!) "	cc
"I want to kill myself 20 I had a lonely and depressing childhood and was an only child. Was raised by my mom who has borderline personality disorder and is very manipulating and neglectful. Never met my dad either. I felt so alone in my life, desperately wanting to be in someone else's shoes but instead, watching my life pass by as others lived theirs.   Since dropping out of college and moving in with my uncle, I've been thinking about suicide more each day. I have no support system and am extremely empty and emotionless. Think I might have aspergers too, not sure. Basically I'm almost ready to give up. To be done with trying to fix my broken self.  "	sw

"Holy shit the waiting time on the Suicide Prevention Hotline Posting this because I have nowhere else to rant. Every time I've gone to the online chat, it's always had a waiting line of 50+. I've actually sat in line for maybe an hour to an hour and a half before finally just closing the tab out of frustration.   I don't blame the volunteers, either: it's got to be an issue with funding. It seems so backwards to me that every time gun violence comes up they say ""It's not a gun problem, it's a mental health problem"" but yet they're willing to devote absolutely zero resources towards mental health resources. I figured if I did it, I'd do it with a shotgun, but now I'm tempted to swap to hanging just to avoid giving these gun lobbyist fucks any money.

Mainly Superfriends was a favorite. Fast forward to afternoon. Ride my bike around with friends. Beyond backyard, there were woods. One time i went back there and found an abandoned graveyard. Another time i found a plastic garbage bag with old Playboys in it. After this if time allowed, I'd play with my Atari 2600. Pitfall or any Activision title. Again fast forward to night.  Watched anything from A-Team, Knight Rider, Airwolf.  Life was good.  And I miss the hell out of it"	cc

Now I’m pregnant and the baby’s father left me. My mom is kicking me out this weekend. I have no money. No job either. I wish I had friends but I push everyone away because I’m “too sad”. I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like a shitty person too because I have nothing to really be sad over there are so many more people in this world that have it worse off but here I am still feeling sorry for myself and hating my life. People have told me it gets better and I’ve waiting a few years seeing if that’s true and it’s just gotten worse honestly. I don’t want to even try to make things better at this point I literally just want to die. I don’t know what’s holding me back. I just wish I had a gun so I could just put a bullet through my head.

"I've wanted to die from impulse since I was little. I'm 27 and have had suicidal thoughts and impulses for about 18 or 17 years. I have these sudden bursts of overwhelming desire to die at the spur of the moment that are overwhelming at times like,  I'll be sitting in the passenger seat of a car and have to stop myself from opening the door and jumping out on the highway.  Jumping into a wild animal exhibit at the zoo. Plunging a knife into my chest that I'm holding in my hand  And I try to put myself into situations where I can die without it being technical suicide I think.  An example i have is about 2 years ago when I was walking home from work late at night I saw this guy who was breaking into a van, I yelled at him and he pulled out a gun and instead of me running away I just sprinted towards him swearing and telling him if you shoot you better not miss and than he just started running. I caught up to him and slamed his head into the asphalt and called the police  Too this day I keep thinking about that night and I wish he just pulled the trigger I don't even care that I caught the guy to be honest I just wanted him to end it. I find myself looking for moments like that again but I'm just never around during the crime and I live in a pretty low crime area town.  My question is do i have some kind of mental illness? Idk if there are even meds or therapy that is designed to help with these thoughts or action? Do you know anything about these tendencies any input would be appreciated.   "	sw

"Suicidal - relationship breakdown I guess this is a scream for help.  My partner/ex-partner is asleep in bed next to me. 4 weeks ago, she told me she wants to leave me. We live together and there's been no arguments, cheating, abuse, anything like that.  She says she loves me but just isn't in love with me anymore. That her schedule (an insanely intensive postgraduate programme that regularly sees her busy 0800-220 or six days a week) has left her not having the headspace for anything else. I admittedly overcompensated for the feeling of distance this term and have got too clingy and anxious about wanting attention and time from her.  We've been talking around and around for a month. We had a week apart and she's abroad for 2 months solid on her programme at the end of this coming week. When she returns, she wants to move out. We live in an expensive city. I will lose her and my home that we worked so hard to build. I would be reduced to living with total strangers in rooms I can barely afford again. Back to square one.  But the real point is losing her. I don't care that it's a cliché. She is everything to me and I cannot ever replace her. I intend to kill myself if she still doesn't want me after having those two months away.   I have calculated everything I would need to do it, and intend to use 3 methods at once to ensure success. I've written a will, advance decision (but I need to figure out someone to witness the signing that won't give it away) and letters to everyone but her - I'll get to that last.   I'll be dead in our garage with instructions on our bed for her to call emergency services to collect me but not go in and not touch anything but her letter so as to not get her DNA on anything.  I don't know if I'm asking for anything. I don't want to die but living without her is more than I choose to so.  I'm already seeing a counsellor but that doesn't solve the actual problem. I guess, does anyone want to tell me anything or ask me anything? "	sw
"One of these days now It's 4am and I cannot sleep, I'm too busy thinking of the various ways to put an end to my life. I think overdosing will be the best way to go.  I have fantasized about my own death for years, knowing that I have the power to end things whenever I can gave me peace. I'm 23 years old and haven't achieved anything in my life. All of my friends from high school are studying to get their masters degree while I had to change major 3 times and haven't got my BA. My parents have invested so much in me but it was all in vain. I will never be the successful son they want me to become. I always hurt thise I love the most (both accidentally and on purpose).

"Fantasizing about suicide Usual stuff: I’m depressed and I have suicidal thoughts. But I don’t see myself doing that in any time soon. Instead, I have just been _fantasizing_ about it.  I try to imagine how I could leave my body to be found... What I would write on my suicide note and what other people’s reactions would be. I picture people discussing the reasoning behind my decision, wondering why I would do it. I think about people telling others of what they have noticed on me that could indicate I was depressed. I think about the message I would leave behind to those who would see me dead. A song. Yes. What I ache for. “What Else is There?”.  The meaning behind these thoughts are quite obvious: they are just attention-seeking thoughts. I have come to accept that. I normally don’t seek for much attention around others. They just occur in my mind. My fantasies.   But I would like to ask people around here what they think about it. If there is anything else that it could mean.  EDIT1: English "	sw

"Anyone tried the ""36 questions that lead to love""?

"What was your last month like? Exactly as the title says, what was your March like?  Mine was rad, over the course of the month I dropped 11 lbs, put on some muscle that I've lost over the years, found out how much I mean to a lot of people, and it's a lot. Not sure if I can live up to it, but I'll do my damnedest to try.  Beyond that, I finally approached a chick that I think is really cute, and it went swimmingly, even when I fucked up kinda hard she at least giggled. Big milestone for me.  I want to hear anything you got from this month, don't be afraid to talk about it or ask me about anything!!"	cc

Today I learned I'm friends with zuck@fb.com.  > Facebook was just starting to become popular before I turned 13 (which is the minimum age for Facebook). Our teachers were telling us not to use Facebook because we could accidentally expose information that could hurt us in the future. Nevertheless, many of us made Facebook accounts with fake birthdays. It was a big deal if someone turned 13 and could change their birthday to their real birthdays. >  > I added pretty much everyone I was acquaintances with on Facebook. My classmates at several schools, my friends at extracurricular activities, my co-workers, people I've met at social events and never seen again, girls on Tinder, and other people I've met online. >  > In other words, I can contact almost every single friend or acquaintance that I've ever made through Facebook. The only friends I can't contact are those from my early childhood. >  > In this scenario, there's no way I'd delete Facebook. If I go to a city that I know a former classmate lives in, I can message them to ask if they want to catch up. If I make a new friend, we'd check our mutual friends on Facebook and easily have something to talk about. If I met someone at a party, didn't add them on Facebook, but want to talk to them again, I can easily find them with just a first name. >  > I have a total of 2 friends who I know deleted their Facebook accounts. This was years ago and they've reactivated their accounts a few months later. >  > For my generation, Facebook's benefits far outweigh the risks. There's no substitute at the moment. I'm younger than the texting generation and older than the Snapchat/Instagram generation.

Talking to people isn't working it's just killing time So many people say they are here to talk but I don't want to talk I want to be dead.

But I’m basically ruining my own life. I used to be a star student, overachiever. Now I do the bare minimum...all I can bring myself to do is watch YouTube videos and scroll through social media mindlessly because everything is so overwhelming. I’m about to graduate and I’ve done nothing. At the same time I have impossible expectations for myself and really want to succeed, but I don’t think I’ll ever be the outgoing, smart, attractive, successful person I want to be. I’m just disappointing everyone, especially myself.  I don’t have many friends and I feel so alone. My social anxiety makes it extremely difficult to even talk to people. I’m already seeing my 6th therapist and I’m on medication, nothing works. I just hate myself so much and I want to give up. Sometimes I wish I’d killed myself in high school like I had planned to. Because now I wish I could, but it feels like I’m in too deep and it would be a bigger inconvenience for everyone. If I could kill myself without it impacting my family I’d do it in a heartbeat.

"Fun fact: your local hospital is almost certainly desperately low on just about everything right now. My hospital only has about 2 weeks' worth of Cardizem left.  That's a very important drug for people with heart problems.  Bicarb, a drug found on the crash carts that we use during resuscitations is critically low.  We're almost out of morphine entirely, and our stores of potassium are looking bad, too.  Fentanyl is like gold right now.  We use that to keep patients on a ventilator sedated.  We've been low or out of normal saline bags for months on end, so we're using other kinds of fluids instead.  We're using sugar water on diabetics because it's all we have, even if it's bad for their blood glucose levels.  We're so low on sterile water that we got an email from the pharmacy saying that we need to be careful with how many patients we have on IV nutrition feeding called TPN right now.  They actually said ""remember, starvation doesn't cause much damage until around day 8, so hold off as long as possible."" The FDA is allowing supplies to be used beyond their printed expiration date so that we can conserve whatever we have on hand.  That's just scratching the surface, too.  We're low on seemingly everything.  So.  The moral of the story is ""don't get sick right now."""	cc
"22 hours, 48 minutes. This is all the time I've got of my last day. There actually were a few things I wanted to prepare before I do it, but I ended up thinking I should spend my last days doing the stuff I would like to do.  I will make a small video, explaining what has led me to commit suicide, and what my thoughts about suicide are. The upload for that video will be started a bit earlier before I head out. I'll stand up at 00:00 in the night, grab a razorblade, a knife, a few other things, and head outside. I will take a walk through the forest nearby, to a place near a cliff that has a beautiful view (you can see for more than 50 kilometers from there). There's a bench neear that spot. I'll sit there. Enjoy the atmosphere of the night, the nice view, for a last time. Then, without thinking much or hesitating I'm going to kill myself.   Either that happens, or a random miracle that solves my problems and (mental) health issues  happens.  From 19 years of living, I only lived seven years without wanting to die.  I have asked for help when I was 12. I wasnt taken serious. I have said that I'm heavily plagued by suicide related thoughts when I was 16, no one helped. I have spent my time and money to find psychiatrists, therapists, people who could help solving my issues. None of them helped me.  I have said I'm going to kill myself within the next days, and again I am not taken serious.  Even if I would get the help now, it is too late. "	sw
"I’m in a bad place. I’ve struggled with depression since seventh grade and usually have it handled at this point in life. I took off from home after high school to a college 8 hours away because I needed to be free and independent. My heart is in English but I’m going to school for nursing like the rest of my family are. I can’t do it. I can’t pass my classes and I feel so incredibly stupid compared to my peers. I don’t belong here. There’s nothing I’m good at. And I’ve never been so unsure of my future before. I’ve never been a bad student. But now I’m rethinking everything. My parents have worked so hard to get me up here, and, if I’m being honest with you, we really cannot afford this university. But they believed in me and bent over backwards to make sure I had a chance. I can’t do it. I don’t know what to do with my future because I’m not good at anything, not smart enough to keep up with classwork, don’t know how to properly study, and tutoring has never helped me. I wish I wasn’t alive right now. I really wish, with all the times I’ve come so close, that I would have gone through with my attempts. I wouldn’t be dealing with this incredible stress and pressure to meet expectations I know for a god damn fact I cannot meet. I feel like I’ve let everyone down and won’t amount to anything in life.

"Currently inpatient in mental health hospital As title explains, I'm currently sat inside a mental health ward due to depression and suicidal thoughts. And I'm still on the same path as I was before admission. I've been in here for one month now, only leaving twice with nurses to purchase cigarettes. I've rejected my family completely, and have only a handful of friends who have visited briefly a couple of times. I've been sedated, quiet and alone with my thoughts enough to see that the struggle isn't ever going to end, and that I am actually looking forward to leaving so that I can stop wasting everyone's time, bed space, and food.   I feel like I've already died but my body just hasn't realised it yet. I don't want anything to do with what has been, what currently is, or what could possibly be in the future. I'm young and otherwise healthy, so people don't understand. And that's OK. I'm not often a selfish person, but I see taking my own life as the one selfish act I am entitled to, and anyone I leave behind can sort out themselves as to how they feel and get on with it.   Life is like a party I didn't want to be invited to, and my friends are enjoying themselves but I am not. I am asking to go, begging, but they insist I stay. My leaving wouldn't mean that they have to leave. In fact, they could easily find other friends to hang around and pass the time with once I go. I'm just too tired and worn down to stay.

"I took the first step in my plan today.. Here's a little bit of back story first.    Basically, I had a kid, and i asked my parents to take guardianship. I was in a bad relationship and stupidly put his name on the kids birth certificate. He's a domestic terrorist, and gets supervised visitation. And hasn't even tried to see the kid in a little over a year. So my first step is making sure that my parents fully adopt this kid, so that he can never get any kind of rights. Since my parents have been saving up money I thought now would be a good time to call our lawyer and figure this out.  I know it'll probably take all year, but that's all part of the plan.   I started a job where I work 96 hours a week, and i make close to 4k a month. What I'm going to do is work, save up money and once I kill myself I'll have all the money I owe my family in envelopes with the letters I'm gonna leave them.  I owe my parents about 3k, and i owe my grandparents about 12k. If I end up making more than that, I'm gonna try and leave the rest to my sister (the child I had).  I plan on getting a doctor to perscribe me the medicines I want, or really anything for that matter. Cause it dosnt actually matter what it is, cause if you can take enough of it, you should die.  I also plan on taking this time to snoop around and find a way into my grandpa's gun safe, and take his pistol. Just in case I feel like the pills arnt getting me anywhere. I'm debating on if I want to do it on a Facebook live post or just keep it low-key so nobody ruins it for me..  To be honest I've been planing this for like 6 months if not longer. I genuinely feel that I'll finally be a good person if I kill myself. I'll stop ruining everything for all the people around me.  I've wanted to die for over 10 years now. I feel like this is basically the best time for it. My life has already been at rock bottom and i still keep finding ways to make the hole deeper. I don't see a real point in being alive, I'm only going to make people hate me. All I do is fuck everything up. So why keep wasting everyone's time?"	sw

Story ends there but it felt so good helping someone new at the gym! The guy was so willing to learn that it actually made him really happy seeing him taking my advice! I felt like I was some sort of mentor lol. Definitely one of the best moments i've ever had in weightlifting that I wanted to share with you guys!

"I'm a survivor of sex trafficking. I want to die. I reposting this to this sub because I haven't managed to find a person to actually talk to and open up to. But yeah, I feel weak and like I can't manage things anymore.  I just feel defeated. I'll start with the basics. I'm 18, I've been through a lot in my life and I recently got out of it yet today I seriously feel just as defeated as I was in my lows of lows.  I was grabbed off the street while walking home from school when I was 15, forced into sex trafficking and was abused in every single way imaginable. I've seen things that you don't even dare to imagine are true. I was getting raped, used, drugged, mutilated, beaten half to death, treated like an object and shit that's even worse on a daily basis. I had to survive being sold to the worst people on this planet. I had to not fight back when these disgusting freaks put their hands on me. I had to just lay there and take it. With every monster I had to deal with, I lost a part of my soul. to the point where I literally just feel empty now. I had to feel the pain of being raped 5 times a day. having thoughts about whether I was gonna make it through the week every day. And the thing is, After all of this I believe them. I believe that I am a piece of sh*t worthless loser. I see myself as fat and ugly. I can't look in the mirror. I hate waking up in the morning, I hate going to bed at night.  I've been out of there for a few months. The first few weeks were fine, But then it just went downhill. I literally hate my revolting ugly reflection. I hate my past. I hate that I can't close my eyes without feeling like someone is gonna walk in and rape the shit out of me till I bleed out again. I just don't feel anything. I feel empty. worthless. pathetic. I don't know if any of this makes sense but after everything I just started feeling like I don't even have ownership of my body. It just been used by so many freaks that I don't even want it anymore. And I don't think anyone will even find me decent looking. I'm disgusting and I'd rather just be dead.  After I got out I honestly tried getting my life put together but now I'm just back to thinking about giving up. I honestly don't see the point in trying anymore. I put all my energy on doing the state test, which I failed and I'm redoing in 2 days. I put all my energy on finishing my high school diploma and I managed to pass everything except math. but that only means I have to retake math hence I won't be able to apply to colleges this year. which only makes my parents more disappointed and pissed at me. My parents don't know me anymore. They expect me to be the same kid I was when I was 14. and in addition to that they expect me to be able to pick myself up and move on in life flawlessly. and they're right. I did want to go to college this year. I don't want another year to be alone with my shitty thoughts.  I got out of all of it, but everyone that's still stuck there couldn't. I had to endure living in a place where if I wasn't something customers wanted, I'd be offed without a second thought. I was getting raped to the point of passing out. I had to deal with the worst of humans. including pedophiles and fucking cannibals. And I got out. and I'm aware that others didn't. And I know I should be grateful. but all I feel is bitter, disgusting and suicidal at this point.  I hate myself. Everything about me is disgusting and I should honestly just slit my wrists the way I was dreaming of doing throughout my time in that hellhole. And I'm sorry again for this not having some inspirational or happy ending. It's just honestly where I am right now and What I'm feeling. This took me a bit to write and I don't know what the reaction is gonna be. I just honestly need a friend to call during the shitty nights.

It’s a 7 and a half hour drive each way, and although we always find plenty to talk about I figure I could use this time to learn something new and interesting with my wonderful mom!   A few things about us:   She’s a librarian and LOVES to learn. I’m a college dropout, but I promise I love to learn too! She’s very open-minded with most things (supports marijuana legalization and knows I’ll be smoking on the trip).  Really the only things that make her uncomfortable are obvious sexual stuff (who would recommend something sexy to listen to with their mom?), violence (this is most important, especially towards animals or children; she won’t be able to sleep), and gratuitous foul language (she likes standup like Joe Rogan but won’t listen because of the bad language.

"I feel like I'm too far gone I've been a shut in for nearly 10 years and my social anxiety has become so bad I can't talk to my own family. No matter how much I want to fix it, my efforts are too small to make change. Anything besides these small efforts is too difficult for me to do. I don't want to interact with people because it's draining and I'm horrible at it, I also am absolutely hideous and short so I feel like everyone is judging me negatively, which makes my social anxiety even worse.  It's hard to see a future where I have a job, a friend, am able to get in a relationship and don't have my entire life dictated by my social anxiety. I don't even know what the point of posting this thread is. Any advice I get I'm too incompetent to do and if someone messages me I'll have an anxiety attack just looking at the message."	sw

"i am not coping, can't get up and go to work. started picking places to die. it's almost 9am and I'm supposed to be at work but i'm in bed.   I haven't had a good day since I found out my best friend from university got accepted on to a prestigious free Masters programme.  Since we both graduated together in 2016 (fine art), she's won a 20k fellowship (i came third in the same student prize, winning £6000 that is all gone now). she's also been granted 20k in government funding and she's done an alternative masters for a year. On the other hand, I have lived in 7 different places in two years, was traumatised by my mothers age-gap husband trying to come on to me, ended up in an abusive relationship that only ended when i ran away in the night, spent 6 months severely depressed and unable to find work, suffered a mental breakdown and had to move back in with my mother. I now work at a gas company doing entry level admin. I am 29 years old.  Recently I went to see a mental health nurse and she told me that I am not able to regulate my emotions because my parents never showed me how. I don't feel any hope that I can learn, I feel like I had no hope from the beginning. I feel like my blood is doomed.  I sometimes wonder if I am fundamentally unable to experience happiness. It seems like, my whole life, I have had a void inside me and nothing will fill it at all. The only thing that has ever come close is when I was making art and getting recognition for it. Now, to see my friend live my dream while I have to live with the consequences of my inability to make decent decisions or any progress as an individual, is intolerably painful.  There is something seriously wrong with me. I believe myself to be broken beyond repair. I look around at the wreckage of my life and I feel no desire to try to repair it. I have no interest in battling SO HARD from here just to have to settle for the shredded scraps of life i'm capable of salvaging. They aren't worth it to me. I know I will never be able to be content with that meaningless slog existence, merely surviving. The opportunities i had to work hard have passed me by and so I don't see that i have a future worth living for. I am a woman and I find nothing more laughable and pathetic than the idea of an aging female delusional artist thinking she has something worth sharing. That is so embarrassing to me, I feel i have no choice but to kill myself. I have looked up articles to try to find reasons to live. Many say that the future is an unknown and that we create our own destinies. I know that my destiny can only go as far as my abilities. I am not talented or personable enough to create the life I truly want. I'm unable to accept less. where does that leave me?   I've been researching the best places to go to die. I already know that the best way will be walking out into the sea. I don't think i will pick anywhere meaningful. I started scrolling around my map app to see if any coastal town names appealed to me.  I wish i didn't have to worry about my parents. I wish they understood that to force me to live out my days in constant disappointment and pain isn't kind.  "	sw

"I'm really feeling close to ending it... I just don't see a whole lot of reason to go on. First, there's my ongoing problems. A 19 year old who is depressed and never leaves home. I have no motivation or aspirations. They've all been drained out of me over the years and has been almost entirely depleted. And even then, I always wanted something outside of my abilities. I'm book smart, and that's it. Math, memory, etc. Stuff in the brain. But I never wanted that for myself. I've lost a lot of interest in video games. And I can't shut myself away and listen to music because my father won't let me. Complained it's too loud, but if I can hear anything, it defeats the purpose. Plus, he goes around with his monotone singing and he can hear his music and he doesn't care.  Which brings up a more recent point. My father has begun drinking hard liquor, a LOT of it. He's become emotionally abusive, insulting his kids, and his girlfriend (my mother), despite her making the sole income. And I don't like confrontation, so I just shut down whenever he gets in my or anyone else's face. My older brother kept him in check, but he has moved out.   I have nowhere to go. I didn't have any real friends in high school. Can't go there to calm myself. I can't get a job. I'm too anxious to go asking for one, and I'm prone to screwing things up. I usually just listened to music and kept to myself, but as I said, I can't do that anymore. I can't even go for a walk because I know I'm going to get scolded about that.  So, to sum up. No support, nowhere to go, terrible home situation, no longer any suitable escapism. I've been depressed since age 12, maybe earlier. I've getting the urge to just literally lay in bed and sleep. Because sleep is the only time I feel safe and okay. I've never committed major self-harm, but my will to live is getting consumed day by day. I don't think I have the courage to end it, but who knows? It's becoming more and more an attractive option... Can someone just... I don't know... What do I do? "	sw

"Waiting for admission decision just to find out about incomplete application About six months ago, I completed a few applications to PhD programs I was interested in. My job environment was toxic, so I decided to quit and move home, just waiting to hear back from these schools. In the meantime, I’ve been working a part time job and put my life on hold.   I was admitted to my back up school in December, but almost immediately eliminated it from contention; I was really waiting to hear from my first choice. It is a prestigious program with only a 3% admissions rate, but I was hopeful.  The website said that I would hear back by 3/31 at the latest, so I followed up today after not receiving any information. When I spoke to the admissions counselor, they told me that one of my reference letters was never received. My application was not even viewed, let alone considered. At this point, the program has filled all of their spots and there is absolutely nothing I can do except reapply next year.  I realize, as an adult, it’s my responsibility to follow-up and verify, but I still feel robbed. I never saw an indicator that my application was not complete and it was labeled as “submitted”. I would’ve much rather been rejected based on merit than this situation.   Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? How did you cope? "	cc

"What's the best dream you ever had? I just dreamt I'm Green Lantern Jwu from a dream where I was Green Lantern. Everything happened fast, I only saw glimpses and yet I understood the entire story.   I popped from nowhere into DC universe. The Ring zoomed into my view. It called me by my name, but it wasn't my actual name! Think it was ""Bryce""? My surname was different, too - American.  So anyway, The Ring told me I have the ability to overcome great fear and I've been chosen. Next, with my comic book knowledge, I used The Ring. I constructed a shield barrier for starters.   Next thing I know I'm fighting robots (very similar to the robots seen in the first episode of Justice League Unlimited Season 1) while still pretty new to making constructs with The Ring. Pierced all of them with giant darts.  There were more battles, and in one fight I was getting my ass handed to me. To renew my strength, I recited the Green Lantern oath. I messed up the last line though. So I had to repeat from the top. I don't know what happened next.  Then, Hal Jordan and John Stewart arrived! Hal said, ""Who the hell is this guy?"" John said, ""He's a Green Lantern Corps? He's too young! He's not from around here!""   Hal was all hostile, kept asking who the hell I was. Told them I don't fucking know, that I'm not from around here, and I don't know why the Ring chose me.  Next thing I know the three of us traveled back in time. If you knew about the Demon Knights DC comics, well we traveled at that time. I binged Demon Knights before I fell asleep last night, so that must be why lmao.  Idk why, but we were looking for Xanadu. The entire time I was like, ""That name's familiar. But, for some reason I know she can help me!"" Then, more battles and shit.   Then, we were in a ruined tower. I remember asking The Ring to scan for heat signatures, for any signs of life. Then, we were ambushed.  Then, we found this Xanadu, a mage chick.   Then, I remember flying in space, Earth in my view. There was this kid, another Green Lantern, who was surprised to see more than one Green Lantern. I ELI5'd Green Lantern to him and Hal helped me explain. For some reason I knew that this kid would take over my position cuz I'm leaving their world. Then, everything went black. I wanted the Ring. I wanted to keep it. But, I lost consciousness.  Then it ended there. I woke up.  Fucking weird. Fucking surreal. Fucking vivid.  Hit me with your best dreams, y'all."	cc

"when shit doesnt work out for me and this last road is closed off im killing myself and none of you can stop me. im basically on the last road out of hell, and it is likely unrealistic for me to expect that there is not a brick wall at the end.  I am sacrificing everythign I have left and giving everything my absolute all to the point where I do not eat or sleep in order to work 24/7 without rest until my body fails me.  my health is in poor condition, and I cannot even take showers, eat, sleep, or use the medicines im supposed to because every second is a mad-rush to work harder. I cannot afford failure and every minute counts, every second of wasted time is a second I will not sleep for days. Its destroying my performance and ensuring failure in the end at this point since I cant keep it up indefinitely.  and its all for nothing, because in the end even if I overcome every possible odd in front of me, there is going to be a wall/hurdle that will be insurmountable at the end.  nobody can help me, and the few who do right now by also sacrificing everything from food to clothes, will not be able to help much longer or will die imminently leaving me on my own with nothing, no bank account, no property, nothing.  not a single family member... pretty much everything.  why even continue? why even fight?  sometimes I say its because im destined to end capitalism and become some kind of communist hero of the people and the most legendary thief of all time who literally steals the future out from under the elite and drives them to be a new underclass.  but thats just the last bits of my sanity failing me and trying to justify my continued existence for a false purpose that can never be won.  I'll probably end up a criminal, if I dont kill myself. probably even a successful one -- I was VERY good at crime for years, being heavily involved in drugs for many years and a highly successful kleptomaniac before that (never got caught, hundreds of dollars of shit) Police who had ideas about me because of association or watching my vehicle loathed me because I was so skilled at defending myself and hiding any and all proof.  im also a good hacker and highly intelligent in computer science, so I can probably be a great cyber-criminal.  but in the end those roads will just lead to more pain, so why not just end the pain once and for all?  why not stop the lack of sleep, the endless nights and the continuous destruction of whats left of my mind and just off myself already?  why keep trying for a better future I know cannot exist for me?  let me tell you something -- unless you can be an exception to the rule, if your starting from nothing in this world there is no equality. you are nothing.  everyone will have unfair advantages over you unless they are equally as impoverished. your intelligence, determination, all dont matter.  all that matters is how many continues you can buy with money. thats what this game is and im fucking sick of it. seems to me society was intentionally designed to pit us against each other like dogs to limit how many people can become successful.  sure, they give you little catch-22s here and there ""oh we'll help under X circumstances"" but if you dont make every decision perfect and meet all criteria thats worthless to you.  Id rather what little social programs and help we get wasnt there at all so that way people would hurt and would be under no illusion that things are ok so they would fucking stand up and fight about it instead of being pussies."	sw

My teeth are otherwise fine apart from the same tooth being slightly in front of my front teeth on the other side.

I can't study since I hate myself so much and I can't find work unless I get a degree in something. The competition for low-end jobs is tough since even those need certain degrees. I still live with my mom when most others live on their own. She is a bit tricky to live with. I don't think she is noticing how bad I feel. She wants me to do more when I already feel like I'm at my limit. I wrote a will yesterday but I haven't decided yet if I'm gonna do it or not. Sorry if it's not convincing. I get that.

What was your first car? What did you pay for it? Mine was a 1980 Plymouth Champ.  I got it from my grandma when i was 16 in 1988. It was not overly reliable but the AC would freeze you to death.  The automatic transmission was not reliable and leaked badly. My grandma did not want to charge me but my dad insisted i pay her something. It was decided i pay her $50 a month.

"Close to Attempt #2 I'm not here to spill all of the tragic things that have happened in my life thus far. Sad things happen to everyone, I'm no different than any other depressed or suicidal person in the world, or on this thread. I wouldn't be hurting people in my life; my roommates and I are pretty independent people. I'm estranged from my very small remaining family who have previously stated they rather see me die than continue to live in ""sin"" (they follow a very strict, extreme form of Catholicism, and therefore my living in sin refers to not going to church, having sex outside of marriage, etc.). I have very few friends now; it would be shocking for a few years but they have so many years ahead of them. I'm 22 years old with no direction, no truly positive aspects to contribute to this world. I've survived through some pretty shitty events, but at some point everyone has a breaking point. I'm smart, but dumb enough to allow my anxieties and depression to successfully ruin the rest of my college career. After this spring semester, I will surely be denied financial aid and be dismissed from my current university in the US. Nothing excites me, nothing motivates me. My one talent, classical piano, is now a pathetic reminder. I went to one of the best music conservatories for a year, and failed out due to my own incompetence. I didn't touch the piano for at least a year, but finally came back to it, only to realize how pathetic my technique became, and how it only reminds me of the time I felt so horrible that I made my first suicide attempt. Ironically, music was the only thing keeping me going until that point, and now it is a daily reminder of how pointless all of my work since the age of 4 has become.   My friends are thriving in their own potential and ways, and I can see how much they value to society and the world; their impacts will be positive ones.   I am also familiar with my pattern; I feel horrible, sick to my stomach at the thought of how we as people have the capacity to feel such sadness. Then I feel numb, empty, and a dangerously calm feeling as I either amend previous suicide notes to a certain few people, or write completely new ones. I've come to the conclusion that no matter how hard I fight, and no matter how ""things are looking up"", they will never work out in a positive outcome, at least for me...whether it is school, friends, family, relationships, a career, nothing will have a happy ending worth working towards.

"This is my life, please read and I would appreciate people’s input. TIA A brief bit about me, I’m a 20 year old male. I’m Irish. I am depressed, anxious, stressed, in constant discontent and unhappiness. When I was 8 years old, my father killed himself. Me and my mother have a very rough relationship and I don’t really have any support from anyone. I can’t fault my mother, she’s fantastic but we just don’t have a great relationship. I’m finishing my 2nd year of college out of 4 years. I am beyond stressed, I am up to my neck in work and assignments and I feel I am very behind. I have no idea what I want to do with my life or what I want to be, the course I am doing in college isn’t for me but I can’t drop out because I don’t have anywhere else to do or go to and it makes it that bit harder not knowing what I want to do.  I’m suicidal and I have the most horrible thoughts. I have no guidance or advice. I really want to feel happy to be alive and I want to feel like I want to be alive. My girlfriend of 2.5 years broke up with me just under two months ago which had a huge impact on me. It was my fault, she was amazing. I don’t feel like I have any friends that I can call a real friend. I don’t really have a person. I find everything so difficult. I have no drive, no determination and have completely lost my will to be alive. I’ve tried to kill my self and I self harm. I really want to be happy. I’m not sure on how to put my feelings into words but I feel like I’m being mentally tortured every day. I’d love if anyone would read this and give me their honest input. I’d love some advice or guidance or help from anyone. It would mean so much to me. Thank you."	sw

Feel like a letdown Current age 18. I overheard my parents discussing a divorce and my name was brought up several times on how my dad hates who I am. I am overweight and he hates that about me which I can understand but he went into more detail on how he hates me as a person and can’t stand to even look at me anymore. My dad and I have a bad relationship ever since I could remember and has made me feel sad after many times he yelled at me but what he said at this current point was too much. His hatred is affecting my family and I don’t want too see that anymore.

"Withdrawing from my medication Hello…  I’m not really at risk, but I do feel quite awful to the extent that it’s overriding my fear of posting. So…  Basically I’ve been severely depressed for years, with no drug or treatment making any real difference, until recently having to work and function independently pushed me so close to cracking completely that I came urgently under the care of a psychiatrist (I live in the UK so that is uh… serious? I mean that the waiting lists are huge and it’s uncommon for them to be too involved in a “mundane” condition like depression).   So, through a combination of them being extremely reasonable and kind, and my being a pharmacist, I was able to get on Nardil, which changed my life (it was like a genuine happy pill and felt like it gave me therapy too—it’s indescribable how effective it was and how thoroughly my thought processes changed).   Anyway, it’s a few months later and I have to come off it due to bad liver results. I’m down from 75mg to 30mg and it feels like a negative dose: I’m crying before I’m conscious, all I can do is be cocooned in bed, and I get into a terribly upsetting state when I’m Skyping with my girlfriend where I want to talk and be happy but I can barely say a word. The most minor and irrational things cause rumination and a plummeting mood, and I’m already stuffing myself with eBay lithium to take the edge off hahaha (it does stop the tears).   It feels like Flowers for Algernon in that I’m watching my capacity to be a happy or content person flow down the drain in front of me. I have hope, in that after a fortnight of no drug, I’m being started on Parnate instead, but in the meantime, this is ridiculous.   I’m not sure I’ll be able to respond to any comments but I am very grateful and, again, am really more just very sad than actively at any form of risk.   Thanks for your time!"	sw
"Holy shit I'm so tired. Need something to get me through the day. Pre-dental student here. Holy fuck I'm barely alive at this point. I literally [feel like this meme](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/651/290/d2c.jpg). It's been a rough week: I've had to finish two auto-tutorial physics units in a week, got two essays due before midnight tonight, had a quiz yesterday, and to top it off, I keep getting indigestion from my school's dining halls. I've slept a total of like 9 hours over the past 4 days. Thankfully, spring break starts tomorrow for me, and I just need something to get me through today. Any of y'all got any ideas?"	cc
Why to try to prevent suicide? We know that life is sucks for 95 of people. And also we know that human life has no objective value at all.   So why to try to prevent suicide and prolong the  nightmare ?    	sw
What are some mundane things you enjoy about your life? I saw this question on a different subreddit and someone commented with a wonderful list and I absolutely loved it. So I wanted to hear moooooore! 	cc
"What did you do on Reddit since your first post, and what are you doing on Reddit now? About a year ago, I started using Reddit, just to see what it was like. I didn't know much about this, ""Redditquette"" thing or how to not get downvoted, so I just posted my first thing on r/LeafyIsHere subreddit, as I did enjoy his content at the time, then drama happened, etc. etc. It got downvoted. I then moved on to r/rhythmheaven because I enjoyed that game a lot, but sadly, the subreddit doesn't get that much traction as of now, so then I moved on r/TownofSalemgame as I tried it out and it was much fun. Was an active redditor on there for a while, then I got bored from the game for about 4-6 months. And finally, I got into CS:GO and started following r/GlobalOffensive, to this day.  Now I come on Reddit just to see what's Hot currently in r/all and I now normally use Reddit whenever I'm bored."	cc
"Inaction Not sure if it count's as being explicit about methods, but the mods will figure out, I guess.  Something that was becoming more and more appealing to me as of late. If I'm so mentally fucked I can't do anything productive to sustain life, then I don't really need to kill myself - biological and economical principles will do it for me. No mess, and rarely do people shame or mourn those who die of poverty - those just wither away both from reality and from memory. The problem is, though, I don't have *any* money... I didn't ever have any money that were mine, as I've always been supported by my mother. And here is the thing: I'd rather die of starvation in the comfort of my home now than on the streets some uncertain amount of time later (when my mom won't be able to support me anymore). But if I just tell my mother straight away that I'm not going to eat today, she won't understand. After enough skipped meals she will probably send me to a psych ward. Yet I can't afford a place to stay alone for any lenght of time really. What do, what do."	sw
"Gave it one last chance, this is the right decision I was going to end it a couple days ago even wrote a suicide note and packed all my belongings up. But I gave it one last shot.   I went to a club for the first time with my only friend bad idea. I looked around and asked why anyone would love me a ugly, anxiety ridden introvert who can't keep a conversation over these 'perfect' looking guys who can make a girl laugh and the looks she wants.   I then went to a church picnic with family feeling dead inside praying for death to take me while the pastor preached. After the service I saw everyone having fun and laughing talking with friends like it's nothing.   Feeling and seeing everyone look at me like I'm a piece of useless trash.  I just need a girl to hold me and tell me she loves me and it will be alright, im pathetic I know.  I've lost 5 pounds in 2 days and lost my appetite completely 2 1/2 weeks ago. Now my teeth hurt. And sever stomach pain after forcing a couple bites.  Now I'm just waiting for the cold numbing grip of death like my first attempt to give me the courage to do it."	sw
"Anyone here play Astroneer? So I really love gaming (it's pretty much the only thing I do outside of school...) and was wondering if anyone else beyond r/Astroneer plays the game.  In my opinion it's a very fun and well-made game that has a lot of promise, but still has a good amount of content (whereas others may bee promising but lack content).  I guess I also wanted to just share this game with other people, since it's (probably) my all-time favourite game."	cc
"I am alone and feel like I have no other options All I want out of life is someone to share it with and I can’t even hold that down. I’m always the one who gets left behind in the dirt to be sad while others continue their happy fucking lives without me. I just want someone to stick with me through the hard parts and keep their promises.   I quit my job that I hated. I thought that would fix everything. But now I’m broke, have a job that is paying way less and my boyfriend broke up with me. He said we could be friends and talk and he’d always be here for me and now he’s saying he doesn’t want us to talk anymore. I’m so hurt. I love him and I was prepared to stay with him for a long time. I feel like he’s putting me on the back burner until he feels like talking to me again. It hurts so much.   I feel like I have nothing. I don’t have friends. I don’t have money to do anything. Most days I know that no one is thinking about me. I’m an artist but even that seems so fucking stupid. No one is ever going to care about my art. I don’t want to struggle anymore - with feeling loved and being happy and making enough money to survive. I don’t think I could ever go through with killing myself but I think about it daily. I know it would hurt my family but I don’t feel like anyone understands the pain I’m constantly in. I wish someone could help me "	sw
"I need help I guess My brother died by suicide a little over a year ago. He was my best friend and I've been fucked up ever since. I had suicidal thoughts before but now I've tried 3 times since. I don't know what to do. My husband is sick of dealing with it. I've been going to a therapist once a week for a while now, he has control of my meds and I'm being good. He's still pissed. I don't know what else to do. I'm trying. What else can I do to make him see I am trying to be normal? I'm not currently suicidal, but if I had to say I think that's probably how I'll go eventually.

"I'm now starting to think that lucid dreaming isn't really a thing So last night I had a pretty intense dream (like you do sometimes), but half way through I remember realizing it was a dream. It was a super casual moment too, but that's not what was my problem was. My problem was that after realizing I was in a dream, I tried to control it. I remember thinking to myself to try and change something, but I couldn't. I thought that was pretty strange before just forgetting about it and moving on in the dream. Anyways, I'm starting to think that lucid dreaming, rather, being able to control your dreams isn't real. This hasn't been the only time this has happened either. I've had a couple different dreams where I've realized I was dreaming, but I even tried to control my dream this time. So what's your guy's opinions on lucid dreaming?"	cc
"I've started to get disconnected with sports. Before it happened, I wasn't a big fan of sports, but I used to keep up with some stuff that was going on. Then, I watched my dad with his local team. They were losing, pretty badly might I add.  My dad was not happy at all, so much so he went to bed earlier. At that point, I just realised how a lot of sports fans just act over the top, over a game. I was pissed, but not because of the result, but because of the reaction from the losing side's fans.  Yes, I know, emotions run extremely high for sports like football (the UK kind, I'm British after all) , rugby and american football, but it's just a little bit too much.  In the end, I'm just going to start to disconnect with sports because I really don't see the fun in watching sports anymore (besides, they're actually quite boring). I'd rather spend the weekend just having fun with something I'm truly passionate about rather than sitting down and just watching some guys pass a ball around for 2 hours.  Otherwise, my day's gone on pretty well, I've almost finished a large part of my dissertation and I'm still excited about the game we're developing for our final year!  So, how's your day going r/casualconversation?"	cc
"I love orchestra I just wanted to tell everyone how much I love orchestra. That's my favorite class of the day. There's never a day where something funny doesn't happen, everyone is so nice, and my teacher has to be the chillest teacher I've ever met. All of my closest friends are in it, and I never leave that class unhappy. Does anyone else have a class or a part of their day that they just enjoy like that? Because it's nice"	cc

Going to restaurants by yourself? I was just wondering what other people's thoughts are on going to get food by yourself?   My friends tend to think it's odd that I sometimes go to restaurants on my own. Personally I don't understand why it seems like a weird idea to them.	cc
"I get confused for being a 28 year old Ever since I came to Japan (from the age 17, now 19) I have constantly been mistaken for a 25+ year old. Yesterday I was shopping for some summer clothes, when the shop assistant came and asked me if I was buying clothes for work.  Also at my part time job, my coworkers (mostly university students) all thought I was around 28, and were hesitant to talk to me. Sometimes do get hurt and sad, by those words. "	cc
"I'm going through meds, therapy, and trying to quit substances yet I still feel like shit everyday I'm doing everything they tell me to get better. Meds, therapy, exercise, quitting substances, yet none of it is working. I still feel like utter shit everyday. At least substances kept the bad feelings at bay. Now I can't even turn to that to feel better. If this is my default state of being, then I'd rather not be at all."	sw
"My life is just miserable and I want to end it Im turning 27 next week and Im convinced that my best years have already gone by. Although I still have a slim, fit body and a youthful pretty face, my hair has started to grey which looks incredibly gross. Thats the reason why I gave up on dating a while ago...who in their minds would want to date a guy in his mid-20s with silver hair? Im doomed to be forever alone. Im so ashamed of my hair that I wont leave my house without a cap. I have also given up on my dreams...I wanted to become an actor (Im very talented) but I think Im too old now to pursue an acting career. On top of that, I live in a third world country that offers no jobs but Im not allowed to get out of here. Sometimes I just lay in my bed all day and cry my eyes out."	sw
"SW Topic of the Day MOVIE CHARACTERS **Quick Note:** this will be the last TOTD for a while as I'm away with work for a few weeks.  I will try to post when I can, but not sure I will get the time.  Welcome to [u/siriuslywinchester](https://www.reddit.com/u/siriuslywinchester)'s Topic of the Day. I'll be coming up with a topic each \(week!\) day and asking questions for you to start discussions and maybe make some new reddit friends! You don't have to answer all of the questions, and you can even just tell a story or some information that relates to the topic if you like.  Today's topic is:  # MOVIE CHARACTERS  Who is your favourite movie character?  Which movie character do you feel like you connect with the best?  Which movie character would you most like to be friends with?  If you could change the actor/actress of any movie character, who would you switch between?"	cc

"I can't wait for Google Earth/Street to update my house view. P This is kinda silly but the last time Google took images of my house was in 2015. Since then I have done massive work on the outside of my house and yard (it's a corner lot) and I seriously cannot wait for them to update the images.   My house looks a 100x better and it actually irks me that people coming to my house for the first time and looking up directions, have the old street view as their first impression.   I realize it's a very silly first world issue but I still wish they would hurry up and update the images.

"Everything I wanted at this point is happening! You know the typical Senior year of college where you get engaged to your boyfriend, you get job offers. I always wanted that but I didn’t think it would happen. I just always thought that layout was so perfect. It would feel like everything in life is coming together. I switched my major and am graduating at 20 with my bachelors, so the switch made graduating come a lot sooner - I was prepared and happy for it but it’s like wow this is really happening this soon! I switched to Computer Science which I’m still extremely new at. But I went to an interview yesterday morning, and they gave me an intern position on the spot! It’s a good paying internship that can last around 6 months, and they like to hire interns after if there’s an opening. I’m planning on doing the best I can so I can get a permanent position there. If not, the internship opens doors for other jobs since it shows I have experience. Plus my boyfriend and I are planning on getting engaged soon, and married in a few years or so. It’s so crazy how things are happening just how i wanted them too, and I’m just super excited about it."	cc
"Calling all YouTubers, my son is now a YouTuber! I found out last night that my 13 year old son has started recording himself playing games on his PS4 and sharing them on YouTube. I actually am proud of him for figuring it all out. He has also figured out how to do it on his phone as well.  I don't expect him to be the one in a million YouTubers that actually make money, but I'm happy that he has taken an interest in doing it. I know that he watches enough YouTube videos to know what he would like to make for content.  What fascinates me is that the PS4 has all the built in features to do all of this. I am starting to feel out dated because of this. I'm a computer scientist and I still get exited to see things like this.  Now some of you would probably worry about privacy issues and if my son is uploading things that are appropriate. Well, now that I know he is doing this I will be closely monitoring him while encouraging him at the same time. I already told him a few tweaks he may need to do to be more appropriate. For example I felt he had an offensive YouTube profile pic so I had him change it.  So what I want to know is are there any of you out there that are YouTubers or have kids that do it? How successful have you/they been? "	cc
Back in the hole This time I'm actually considering killing myself noone likes me except for my family that I don't like back. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do in life. I have little to no chance of becoming anything I hate myself over anyone else I don't have the balls to tell the girl like that I like her. I don't want to exist. I wish my parents didn't migrate here so they wouldn't have met each other. They might care for me but I don't. I'm just a big burden. I wish I had a gun. Shooting myself in the head would be so easy. I hate everything I say and do. I can't sleep at night. I hate this. What is the easiest and most painless way to die? I'd also like it to a guarantee. I can't do this anymore. Fuck fuck fuck. I hate this so much. Fuck. I just want to not exist.	sw
"One thing that bothers me is when people think I'm pessimistic, though I am a realist Is it just me that gets called pessimistic for just not being optimistic 24/7?   Sure, I can be hyped for something in the future for example me going to university soon, but I just can't be optimistic about literally everything if there is nothing to be optimistic about.  I'm a realist, I see things as they are, not as what I want them to be while trying to put everyone's mood down because I think differently. "	cc
"I just learned about the social credit system that exists in China and it immediately reminded me of 1984 At first glance, I started to think that this could be [a good concept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAIKh7AnTIk) from a legal perspective in order to unconsciously pressure people to obey the law and decrease criminal activity but this can go so badly that this will literally turn into an obedience type of system.  Heck, who knows if this is what they are planning all along?  You buy something that they do not like? Get a low score and your chances of getting a job is lowered.  You like something that a political party does not like? Your score is lowered and everyone sees you as lower than low and become a second-class citizen.  You want to protest or challenge something that is not condoned or not exactly something that the government is in favour of? Your score is lowered and your voice is meaningless.  Goddamn it, it is such a scary thought that some people in the video think that it is a good idea on a surface level but holy hell, it is pretty scary on a deeper level. Almost like a 1984 type of story where your every single behaviour is monitored and rated into however those in charge see what can be considered as  ""desirable"""	cc

"I have to write 15 pages today Hi guys!  So, this is one of my last college assignments before I graduate. I have done most of the research and I roughly structured the text, or at least how I want it to look but today will be stressful no doubt. I pushed all the blame aside, of course it was stupid to not start earlier with the text but this is the situation now and I have to make the most of it.

I'm too hard on myself and so many other things and I don't want to even think about it.  But I think about it so much about everything.  About how I struggled through college. About how I lost the girl I love and miss her.  About how much I hate myself and hit myself. All I've done really is hit.  Punch myself.  Hit in my face. Mouth. Eyes.

Have you met a 'charmer' who turned out to be a complete fraud?  Here are a few things that I've come across:  1. They're too eager to tell their story. 2. The stories are very dramatic (like something out of a movie), usually pitting them against the world. There is drama and injustice, which somehow will relate to their current predicament. 3. They take lots of selfies (or at least one of them did). 4. They think they can outsmart whatever system it is they wish to circumvent. 5. Their personal life is in tatters. 6. They're chronically short of money. What say you? What frauds have you met, and/or escaped?"	cc

"I turn 32 tomorrow and my life is pointless I’ve reached a point that I see nothing in the future I wish to enjoy. Everything seems utterly pointless. I quit my job at the end of 2016, traveled all over the US for most of the year and even went overseas multiple times for volunteer work and pleasure. I’ve done things this past year that other people dream of doing, yet I am completely jaded. I’ve struggled with depression my entire life, but since August 2016 it’s been worse than ever before and I don’t know how to get out of this hole, or even why I would.  My wife of eight years told me in August 2016 she wasn't in love with me anymore, ends up she had started sleeping with a guy from her work, who she's now living with. Lot's of crazy things happened with her from August until July last year, when she finally moved and never spoke to me again. We’re still technically married, but zero contact in almost a year... well rejection hurts. I know that was where a lot of my depression still stems from, but this feeling that life is pointless feels impossible to shake. During the split from my wife, I basically let her have everything but one of our vehicles, some clothes, and camping gear and I hit the road. I went to 26 National Parks, did crazy hikes, spent two months surfing on the coast in Oregon, loads of snowshoeing and snowboarding, etc. but I also suffer(ed)really bad from insomnia and spent countless nights weeping in my car. Days without eating or sleeping caused my weight to drop and I’ve been hovering around 160, down from my 2016 weight of 220(an at first welcome to my depression, but I’ve now seen as unhealthy).  I had been told I should volunteer to get out of this funk, so I went to Ghana Africa for two months to assist in building an orphanage(I'd done this a few times before in other countries)and I didn't care. I did the work I went to do, I played with kids, etc, but I didn't care and was left cold. I've been back in the states for six months now. Traveling again around the US often. I was told to get a different hobby besides hiking and traveling alone, so I started taking ceramics again at a local craft guild as I majored in ceramic arts in college, but that too hasn’t lifted this cloud. I’ve been told to try to date again and I’ve seen women and slept with them, but I’m not attracted to anyone and my sex drive has bottomed out. I know a lot of this must sound crazy, but I worked to be able to experience a lot and always said yes. Now I look back and I don't know what it was exactly I was working for or why I did so much? There's little I look back on and care to remember. I recognize I should be grateful for what I have, the friends I have, and experiences I have, but I'm not and I feel guilt and shame for that, which causes me to close up even more. I’m currently taking Zolpidem and Trazodone and they aren’t helping at all. I use marijuana frequently to try and feel something, it at least gives me an appetite, but that’s about it. I’ve had the epiphanies at different times that things are going to turn around.  A few weeks ago I was in Death Valley NP, standing at the lowest point in North America and thought out loud that the only direction from here was up! And felt good for a moment, but that moment was so fleeting and felt fake afterwards.   I’m 32.  I have friends that care about me.  I have a family that loves me. I have experiences others dream about. And it all feels like nothing.  My father in law committed suicide during my first year of marriage, along with one of my best friends in high school. I recognize it’s the “easy” way out, I just don’t think I can take this hard path any longer. I’m tired. People know I’m tired. I feel like I’m pathetic when I’m around anyone, like I should be over things, moving on with my life, but it’s like a pause button was pressed and I’m supposed to suffer here.  I don’t know what else to say. "	sw

"I can't stand CTL right now I'm training for crisis text line and I'm hating some of their rules for helping texters.  They're trying to make me talk like a robot instead of an actual person someone could relate to.  Like you can't talk about yourself even if the texter asks (which makes no sense since we're trying to make them feel less alone).  And you're supposed to mirror back to them how they feel ""instead of parroting"" but it's still pretty much just parroting in the examples they give because they say how the texter feels right after they do which doesn't add anything.  And you have to give complements that are true but the examples feel so ingenuine ex.:Your willingness to reach out for help is truly inspiring.  I had to watch a  video of an actual CTL conversation and if I was that texter I wouldn't have felt uplifted at all (but that texter did feel better at the end so maybe the people who use CTL are the easiest to help I don't know).  Has anyone used CTL or anything like it and what do you like/not like about it because I want to get them to change their rules.  "	sw
"I'm feeling a lot like Pinocchio, and I want to cut my strings. It's like I'm being played with. I spend weeks trying to build myself back up after being left alone, and I get fucked over by one message. It's like it's a fucking game for someone to break me over and over and over and fucking over. I could've had tomorrow off work, and I would've maybe been able to process this. I work tomorrow, and I'm at a really big risk of ending it all. Honestly might just do it right now. It's not hard to die. I honestly never wanted to say these things again. It's like being punched in the gut. I've almost puked multiple times. I can't sleep at all, and I'm unable to enjoy what I was doing. The only way I can rationalize how much I'm being hurt is someone is playing with me. Maybe it's God, who the fuck knows. I'm just so tired. I might finally have to admit myself. Or hopefully I can finally kill myself. Probably going to steal a car and drive it off a cliff, that sounds fun compared to the other ways to die. If YOU are reading this, just stay away please. Stay away or never leave. If you don't I'm going to fucking shatter. I'm already so cracked and broken I don't know what'll happen. This might be goodbye everybody, hope ya'll figure out your problems."	sw

Absences already 15 this semester.  No one really notices how I haven't said any weird plots, told stories, show my writing.  No one really notices how I've deleted 5000+ of photos on my phone without backup.   No one really notices how I've changed all my wallpapers and profile pictures. No longer the fictional character that I relate to, and makes me going.   No one really notice how I deleted Messenger and Facebook.  No one really notice I don't ask for my mom's data all the time now. Barely touching my phone now.   No one really notice I have been skipping meals. They just think my stomach hurts.   Just thinking about it hurts. So if I die tonight... would they suddenly notice it? I doubt though. I really hate this life. "	sw
"My last post I posted here two weeks ago and because of some kind words from strangers, I decided not to kill myself. It's been two weeks and nothing has changed. I feel even more isolated and alone. I spend most of my days trying to hold back tears. I have no one. I am sick of being an outcast I'm sick of being a weirdo. I can't do this anymore. I've tried. There's no place for me in this world, life doesn't get better for people like me. I have no worth, I have no family. I have no one. I feel like death is my only option to escape this pain.

"Very Soon Probably going to do the (((((stupid thing))))) very soon. This weekend I'm going to have access to a handle of vodka. Now, even if I manage to drink the entire handle, the alcohol poisoning isn't guaranteed to kill me. So, I might slit my wrists the long way, but that's not really a guaranteed thing either. So, if I'm still conscious, I'll have to go find a secluded cliff or something to jump off of so no one has to clean up my body. God, I just hate myself. So. Much. My anti-social tendencies, low self-esteem, my attraction to a type of person that literally doesn't fucking exist, literally fucking everything. I used to be something. Had decent grades, was decent at swimming, people told me I could go to any school in the country if I wanted to. My mom would just parade me around to her friends because I was so ""smart"". ""Oh, my 2nd grader knows how to spell sarcophagus, he's so smart! xddddddd"" I'm not strong enough to change. I'm a weak-willed, weak-bodied piece of shit who will literally never amount to anything. I probably don't even have the spine to kill myself either, and I'm just making this empty threat to internet strangers as a subconscious scream for help. Maybe I'm just venting my thoughts for once just because I might not have a lot of time to start speaking up (this isn't really speaking up but whatever). I just wish I could never have existed, never have had an impact on people's lives, never have been a financial burden on my family, and never worried anyone with my suicidal tendencies. I don't want help, I want to not exist. i want to fucking scream. Just realized that this is going to get deleted because I explained how I'd do it, but whatever. I don't ever say anything anyways, so it'll just be like usual where nothing I say matters. Go ahead and delete this mods, please"	sw

"second post i posted last night, but they never published it.  its okay.  it needed to be said, not read.  i havent slept in 2 weeks, and when i wrote it i was very very very drunk trying to sleep.  i realized i forgot to tell someone it isnt their fault at all.  my brain doesnt work normally, and all my tries at getting medical help led to a psychiatrist who told me they didnt have time to review my mental health record, medicine is a placebo, and they would reccomend one of the medications that had previously resulted in a suicide attempt.  i begged them to speak to my team, but they told me i was a drug addict, and if i didnt want to try the medication they were pushing on me, i could leave.  Im done trying.  I just need to tell that person it isnt their fault, but i cant access hangouts because i left my phone, knowing they would use it to track me. I gave myself until this age, and now the time is here and I just need to sleep.  my neurology is all wrong.   my brain never shuts off.  never.  and the one new medication that actually helped me is completely denied to me, on all the many times i tried.  today, i reached out to my old doctor, and someone was going to send it to me.  i asked if they could fax it, but the pharmacy aid the doctor had to do it from his office.  they were closed when the person got back.  I told them it was going to be okay, that we did our damndest.  I didnt tell them they gave me the happiest moments of my life.  For 5 years i finally had a place to say i belonged in.  i was loved and cherished, but my brain doesnt shut off.  i can manage with my meds, but i havent had them in 3 months, and now, these past two weeks, nothing works.  nothing works.  no one wants to waste their time looking into my history, and i cant go through the pain of them playing with my meds again.  i just wish i could access hangouts and let them know it isnt their fault at all.  my brain was never wired right, and this has always been inevitable.  i told them this often, but people dont believe honest people when they say that.  and now im almost to my destination, and i cant even tell them it isnt their fault for breaking up with me.  i cant sleep.  i cant do this all over again, after the 7 years of hard fight every day just to try and seek help so i can try.  im exhausted.  i just wanted to tell them that, and now i cant even do that.  thank you for reading, and i hope he comes across this and knows its me.  i just needed to sleep.  i just want to sleep."	sw
"I just can't do it anymore. Every time I think my life is under control it all turns to shit. I try to keep it together for the sake of my daughter. She is the only thing keeping me alive. She is a year old and I think how sad it would be for her to grow up without a mom. Of course I also think how sad it will be for her to grow up with a mom who is as mentally fucked up as I am.   There is no winning in my situation. I want to end it so badly but have always been too chicken-shit. I have prayed to get some terminal illness so I won't have any guilt for dying. The guilt of ending my own life also keeps me alive.   I've been drinking a lot more than ever and have considered taking up weed again. Maybe that would help. I don't want to be happy, I just want to feel ok. I have always felt I am not cut out for this world. I'm too sensitive and weak. I was sexually abused from 6 years old until 17 years old. I never did anything to stop it despite having multiple chances to do so. I am haunted by it. There have been other traumas in my life as well and at age 35 I am tired. I'm so tired of everything.   I tried therapy but I kept getting switched to different doctors. I can't heal if I have to keep telling the same things over and over to different people.   I am plagued by nightmares and never want to sleep. I feel if I stay up that tomorrow will never come. But it does and I live the same day over and over. I am stuck. I wish I could disappear from this existence and start over somewhere else. Again, the guilt keeps me here. I can't abandon my girl, she is truly the light of my life. She is amazing and keeps me hanging on, hoping for a better day.   I want to go but I want to stay. I hold on to that small sliver of hope and fear that someday it will slip away. I just needed to vent. I hate these bad days, I hate my brain, I hate myself, I hate everything. I hate that I posted this, I just don't know what else to do right now. "	sw

I'm going to school for sport management but I just can't take it sometimes. When the Patriots were down at halftime to the Falcons I got in my car and drove to the nearest bridge and just sat there with the radio on. I was able to just breathe and eventually made it home without doing anything wrong.  I've broken phones and controllers and doors and everything from getting so emotionally invested in games and watching my teams lose. Nothing triggers my suicidal thoughts more than this. Sports, video games, MTG, anything competitive whether it's the team I support or me myself losing I just can't handle it.   I was already in a dark place and this national championship game just put me one step lower. Arguing in the game thread, saying shitty things to people and them saying shitty things back has just made it worse and worse. I'm trying to calm down and do things I like but then my dog went and fucking bit me now I'm just over the line. I'm fucking done and just have nothing else I care about, nothing to look forward to, and I really just feel like I have no other options than ending it all.

I keep realizing The Pixies have influenced my music tastes more than I know. I'm 24 but I've always been a huge fan of 90s alt rock and indie music. Found the Pixies years ago (probably from a Kurt Cobain interview where he mentioned them or maybe their song being featured in Fight Club) and really fell in love with the albums [Doolittle] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZRpANN4NF8&list=PLhj6R3nBEgyIdyIVKV2XDfDUdyhcWsWpw) and [Surfer Rosa] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaYNwEoYzmI&list=PLggUsCKb74eI1GCaRpdXXq9wJ-Htsozij).  A couple weeks ago I picked up [this album I've always really liked] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5CJg4kZtnM&list=PLA51A0F1571794570) by a band called Black Francis and gave them an obligatory google then realized it's a band by the lead singer of The Pixies Francis Black.  Today I was listening to this song I really love by [The Breeders] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFIOKQpHfHU) and googled them to find that the band leader is Kim Deal from The Pixies.  I feel like kind of an idiot for not knowing these things. I wonder what other bands I listen to unaware of who's in them?	cc

"Have you ever tried to cut down on Reddit? Don’t get me wrong, I love Reddit. But, I’ve had to step back from Reddit several times in the last couple years and evaluate whether it’s a beneficial or detractive force in my life.   I like the community aspect and I’ve had some good discussions and a lot of good laughs. But at times my Reddit use has been compulsive in its frequency. I’ve gotten in many heated arguments, fallen for many fake or misrepresented news stories, witnessed many Reddit controversies, and found quite a few toxic communities. As a somewhat neurotic individual, sometimes Reddit can get rather overwhelming for me.  I’ve tried ditching Reddit several times, but I think I’ve gotten a grip on it now. Lately I’ve culled almost all news subreddits from my front page. I’ve also started listening to more podcasts and generally reduced my redditing to what I (for now) perceive to be a healthy amount. I’m arguing substantially less than I used to, and Reddit has been much less mentally and emotionally draining lately. So I think things are looking up.  ———  Anyone else have mixed feelings about Reddit? Similar experiences? Different experiences? What did you do?"	cc
"Do you think it's condescending to tell a child 'Your parents raised you well'? I remember my mother telling me off when I was eleven for going to school with muddy trousers. I'd played a bit of rugby after school and wore the same trousers the next day without washing them because I didn't consider it much of a problem at the time. My mum was upset that I hadn't washed them or wore clean ones, and when it was clear that I didn't understand the problem at all, she threw in that it also makes teachers think that she's not looking after me. I didn't understand this at the time, because in my mind it was my responsibility to wash my clothes not hers, but as I got older this memory stuck with me and I realised it's the truth. The way a child acts and appears reflects massively on the parents, but as a child I didn't view it that way.  So my question comes from last night. I was playing the game *Fortnite Battle Royale*, and for those not familiar with the game you can get paired up with three other strangers and have to work together to beat all the other teams. Teamwork is essential, and using your microphones to chat is also really useful.  I was paired up with a twelve-year-old boy and two American college students. I don't usually like playing with children, but this kid was pretty polite and a nice guy to play with. He wasn't good at the game, but he did his best to share all the items he got with the team and gave us all the info he had so no problems there.  Something that bugged me though is that the two other guys repeatedly told him 'your parents raised you well' whenever he said please/thank you or helped us out. He always replied with an awkward laugh and a 'thanks', but to me, it seems condescending to say that kind of thing. I didn't speak up at the time because that would make things awkward. Thinking back to my muddy trousers story, when I was a child I disliked people relating my actions to my parents.  What do you guys think about this kind of thing? "	cc
"I Want To Be Dead I am 21 years old and have been dealing with suicidal thoughts since around middle school. I dropped out of high school in the beginning of my 11th grade year for a few reasons, one of them being that I was planning on killing myself soon after. It has been about 4 years since then; I have been hospitalized for mental health reasons twice in that time. There is so much that I could write about, and I find no *real* reason not to write about as much as I can. What's the worst thing that can happen -- nobody reads it?  I'm so young, there are so many things that I can do with my life -- so why is it that I want for it to end so badly? I believe in my ability and my strength to get better and to be better, yet it doesn't seem to matter to me all that much. Sure, right now I'm not in such a great spot. I'm experiencing agoraphobia-level anxiety, severe apathy, and I stopped taking my prescription medications some weeks ago because I got frustrated with not feeling any better after months and months of experimenting with different combinations prescribed by my psychiatrist. I stopped seeing my counselor, too.  I feel as if I were to kill myself any time soon, there will be people who blame the fact that I stopped treating my mental illness. It's frustrating, but I accept it. There may be people who will discount my suicide as irrational and/or impulsive. I believe there will be people who will question my sanity. It's all beyond upsetting, but I've been around long enough to know that preoccupying myself with what people think and say is a waste of time. I'm not in control.  So if I am sane and it's not the lack of medication, why do I want to kill myself?   It's kind of funny to me, really, how calm I am. I've thought about killing myself so much that it's normal for me. I'm not hopeless, I've just made up my mind.  I've made my decision that I want to be dead. Not because I think misery is inescapable, but because I think dealing with misery is inescapable. I've made the decision that I don't want to keep taking on all the things that life has to offer, not even for all the good things, because sometimes even the good things stress me out. I'm tired of being stressed out. I don't want to deal with it, I want to escape it. I already know I'm capable of dealing with stress in a healthy way, I just don't want to. I know that maybe with time, healthy coping mechanisms could become like second nature to me, it doesn't matter. I don't want to work at it. I don't. I'm tired. I'm tired of dealing with things. What I want is to *not* deal with things. Everything.  I still have things that give me joy. I still have things I want to do. I have places I want to go, things I want to make, books I want to read. I'm tired, though. I'm tired of being awake. I'm tired of wanting. I'm tired of doing. I'm tired of being.  To keep on living requires energy that I don't have. I don't want to be better. I want to be dead.  It doesn't matter what counselor I see or what medications I'm on. I will never get better if I never try, and I don't want to try anymore.  Committing suicide scares me, because I am scared of what comes after, both for me and the people who care about me. I am scared of failing to kill myself and destroying my body and/or mind. I am scared. I am scared of all the things that could be if I were to keep on living. But what scares me the most is what I will go through if I were to keep on living. I am scared of struggling, and I don't think I would ever believe that there can be a life for me without struggle.  I could learn to manage those fears. I could learn not to be so scared of the future and what it may bring. I could learn to avoid thinking about killing myself when I get stressed out. I could get better, I could be better, I could be healthier and I could be happier.   But I don't want that.   I want to be dead."	sw
"I'm too lazy for life. I'm 20, still live with my parents, don't work, and don't attend university. I was recently given an ultimatum of either get a job or leave. If my options are either be miserable for the rest of my life making minimum wage just to barely afford to stay alive or to be homeless and slowly starve to death, wouldn't quickly kill myself be the best option?

"How to tell someone I keep trying to kill myself? So, I'm 16 and I have tried or come close to killing myself every day for the last week and a half. I took an od last night and then got scared and threw it up. I don't know if I will do something tonight, I probably will try or come close to it. I feel so helpless. If I had left the house in the last 9 days I would have jumped off the bridge very close to me or just ran off. I can't go outside because of my eating disorder, as I am so ashamed of how I look currently that I avoid all my mirrors, and can't stand the thought of someone seeing me. This means I might not go to therapy next week and I am scared something bad will happen, or if I do, I will likely end up lying.   Someone knows, and has been there every time I have said things like this, and refuses to leave,but I'm finally pushing them away as I feel them getting more frustrated that I know nobody cares about me or something of the same variation.   I don't know what I am supposed to do. If I talk about this I will probably end up sectioned and I cannot miss school and I haven't been revising for my gcses in a month. I am scared I will be forced to eat or open up about my ED (not an option) and my parents will be told and have a conversation (not so supportive) and I can't stand that. I can't go on pretending I am not a risk to myself, but I don't know how to start the conversation. Any help greatly appreciated.  "	sw
Stupid Rambling I'm a weak person. Every negative comment I get about myself I take it to heart and those comments pop up in my head for years to come. I can't brush them off like most people. If a teacher were to slightly raise there voice at me I immediately feel guilty and want to cry. I don't know why I'm like this and I wish there was a way for me to not be like this. When things get hard in my life I just start crying and complaining instead of doing something about the situation. I'm useless. I don't think I'll do any good in this world. I'll just spend the rest of my life crying and complaining. I'm complaining right now.

"60 day rule There is a 60 day rule at school. You can't cause trouble, get suspensions, etc. What the 60 day rule means to me is that I have 60 days more or less to live.   I've always knew I had to kill myself before graduation. There are many reasons:  - Waste time after high school  - No college because I don't know what to do  - Waste money and time at college costing thousands of dollars in debt  - get yelled at constantly for not doing anything with my life and mooch off my family to keep living  - I see no future in myself, at all.   No college, no job, no dream, nothing. It's not just because of my depression, I just don't see myself after high school.  I decided to kill myself before my high school graduation so that I feel like I haven't wasted 4 years or longer trying to survive for nothing. If I were to live on, living for a meaningless piece of paper with my name on it does nothing for me. Crossing that stage is like commitment, even though I know it's not. It's like taking a step into another direction. I don't want to put my foot in."	sw

"I made a bookmark in my memory as a child to reflect on as an adult I remember being a young child, about 7 or 8, standing on my assigned crossing duty corner one morning before school bored as hell and spacing off. I was pondering myself and what I was going to be when I was older. I’ve never really had any dreams or ambitions in particular, so I imagined myself in different adulty roles. I came to the conclusion I had no idea what I would look like or be when I was older, so I decided to remember everything about that moment in its entirety so I could look back and reflect on it once I finally had my answer.

"It's the best feeling ever when you find money that you didn't know you had. Well, one of the best feelings ever. It's 1:30 am here, and I just had Christmas morning early. This post is probably showing my youth and also the fact that I'm broke, but oh well.   I have this big bookcase, and it's chock full of books, plus a lot of other things. I'm not sure why I have so many little things other than books in there, but I do. Deep in the depths of my bookcase, I found a wallet that I used in middle school; it felt full. I opened it, and - oh damn, it's money! Not just a few bucks, but $35. I'm practically rich now...I wonder what I'll do with all this cash. Realistically, I'll use it to ""treat myself""(aka just spend it for fun).   Does this ever happen to you? Or no, because you are a responsible, organized person who only uses your bookcase for books, and never finds anything hidden in your closet. If it's the latter, then good for you, because that's definitely not me.   Aside from that, how's your day/night/odd inbetween hour? What's today or tomorrow going to look like? "	cc

what would have changed in your life if you weren't on reddit. ? I've been on reddit for around 18/19 days and here's a question which I always think when I am afk. Would it matter if you weren't on reddit.  What draws you towards this typical social networking site. ? 	cc
Im always wrong.. Whenever I ask for advice on advice sites or q&A's people always tell me I am overreacting or that whatever I say is wrong and I'm the bad person it's always the other person that is right and I'm the bad guy in the situation... Does anyone else have this problem? It sometimes makes me feel alone.   This even happens in real life..	sw
"Nothing's wrong with me I'm over the sexual abuse as a child and subsequent drug use later in life. I don't care about that stuff anymore. There's nothing wrong with me I just don't see the point. ""Life is beautiful"" is not a good enough reason to get out of bed. I have no motivation and I have no energy.  Every time I wake up I have to convince myself that it's worth it and the side that says yes is losing now. I tried once I'll probably try again. There's just nothing to make it worth it for me anymore. ""My family will be sad"" is only going to work in my head for so long.  Hopefully soon I stop caring completely. Nothing is wrong, I just don't see the point anymore. There isn't one."	sw

I'm tired of getting up every morning to deal with the same shit, get the same results, and keep failing at being happy. I think that today might be my last day going through the motions.

"I'm probably going to die on Thursday Initially, I wanted to meet with a friend that I had destroyed my relationship with. I wanted to fix it and know where I went wrong and what to do in future. Additionally, I would meet another person, who had deeply hurt me and kept hurting me. I wanted them to understand what they were doing and try to fix that etc.  I was going to kill myself only if I couldn't fix both. Like an ""AND"" logic gate.  Then it all fell apart, first the second person treated me like a subhuman, then, since they knew each other, they wanted to meet at the same time, rich meant that it was more likely that it wouldn't work because there was different information and they could defend each other – the discussion would get nowhere.  Lastly, the first person decided they didn't want to meet anymore. And the second person probably won't want to either.  I was about to shoot myself when I decides to do this, and when they both agreed, I put suicide on the shelf. Now it was for nothing.  I'm going to kill myself on Thursday (this was when we were supposed to meet) or Saturday when everyone is out of the house. I'm done with this pain and this world and this everything.

I’m really in love with him which makes this decision a million times more difficult and all my friends tell me I should go but I’m still confused.

I don't want to let him go, he doesn't want to let me go but it hurts so much being friends and knowing we love each other but it'll never work.  I self harmed on my face. I can't go outside because people will stare. I did it to calm me down. I want to die, I've attempted before in the past but now I want it more than ever.   No one would notice I'm gone. I have no friends. And I know my mum and siblings will eventually move on.  I don't want to leave my cats because they always come over for cuddles when I'm sad.

When I got back on Wednesday, she mentioned how the company didn't remember. Normally on someone's birthday management gets a card and sends it around for everyone to sign.  So I mentioned it to my team lead who said since she was new they didn't have her birthday on the birthday sheet yet but she'd make sure to add it and get her a card.  Today, my co-worker comes over and says look at this card that was on my desk this morning.  It was a simple card that said happy belated birthday.  However, the card was not sent around for signatures and it was signed ""From (team lead's name) and the team"".  Kim was like ""this is shitty"", ""why even bother at all?""

"My Life Story For my whole life I've been incredibly lonely, no one would ever invite me to do any activity. It didn't help that I used to live in the middle of nowhere so it was difficult to make friends, even during elementary school nobody would want to even talk to me, the ""ugly"" kid. It took my 2nd grade teacher to literally ask the class who wanted to be my friend and no one raised their hand except for like 1 person, from that day I thought he was my friend. But once middle school came around he started to hang out with other people and I was alone again, the people he would sit with at lunch didn't bother to make any room so I usually sat at the table next to them. Alone, as usual. But over time I started to have people talk to me and it was pretty good, I mean I was still lonely but it isn't like I was left in the dust but some people did talk to me.   I moved at the beginning of the second half of 7th grade and I went to a new middle school where I was lonely once again for a little while (the usual new kid situation) and then one day I started to get talked to and started to make friends and even got a girlfriend, but shit changed after she dumped me. Suddenly no one wanted to interact with me and the people who were my ""friends"" didn't want me around them anymore. Now I was the loneliest kid in the entire school and everyone began to bully me, I started to get even more depressed to the point where someone reported me to the counselor and there was this massive conversation where they were trying to make me confess that I was suicidal. Now, I was, but I didn't want them to get involved and thought I could solve shit myself. But the loneliness kept going until the end of the year. Apparently I failed 7th grade and I was absolutely devistated. I tried my best to get my grades up but no matter what I did nothing happened, the teachers would say that they would help but they never did. I should also bring up that my ""friends"" from my old school never talked to me, no texts, nothing.   Fastfoward to 8th grade, I was put into a Renaissance school to help get me ready for 8th grade (they moved me up so that was more possible or something I don't remember) and that was it, during the year I made some friends. At least people that would give me the answers to stuff that I needed help on so that was fine, I still didn't really talk at all and some people still made fun of me but it wasn't as extreme like 7th grade. But after awhile I started to report somebody for being an absolute cunt to me for no reason, there was this one incident on the bus where I asked her how would she felt if I killed myself and she just laughed at my face. But when I reported her and after signing a contract (basically a ""don't come near me"" form) and I began to describe what happened that day on the bus and he asked if I ever had suicidal thoughts and I said yes. Just to make things shorter I got a school therapist to help me, and you know what? She did help... Until I went back to the middle school, suddenly everything she helped me with came back to me and her words didn't matter. Somehow though I got another girlfriend and just like the last relationship it ended. I should mention that the last two relationships lasted for like a fucking week, so it didn't help that it was that long and made things worse when it was either on or the day after Valentine's Day. So I'm completely devistated again until I go onto High school. I forgot to mention that the reason why I moved was because my parents split, so my dad moved to one place and I moved with my mom. But after 8th grade I went with my dad in hopes to start over again.   I had a great time during 9th grade and the first half of 10th grade, like for the first time I finally had friends and people to joke with. At home I was alone and inside but at school I was talkative and had people to talk to. But at the same time I started to have a friendship with my 8th grade ex gf, after awhile we became close and I trusted her with my issues and she would talk to me. I started to have feelings for her again because of how close I was with her. I thought I was the only one that went through the same issues but she was there for me. It started again after 8th grade during the summer and I loved her so much for being there for me and I wanted to go back for her since she was starting to become my best friend (something I've always wanted in my life) but at the beginning of the 2nd half of 9th grade I started talking to an 8th grader who I also wanted to see badly because I was starting to like her as well, since she was coming to high school next year I decided to stay at the school to see her. Here comes 10th grade, where she was finally at the school and I could see her. Things... Didn't go well... After awhile she didn't talk to me at all nor wanna acknowledge me. She would talk to her friends but it was me that she didn't want to really interact with. At this point it would've been 2 years since I had a girlfriend and why that is something I'd bring up is because I felt pressured to have a girlfriend, everyone was constantly posting about ""omg look at how amazing my babe is"" and I wanted something like that. But it felt like everyone was taken or had a specific preference. I wasn't anyone's preference. The people I liked would never talk to me and if they did it was only for like a week and that's it. I wanted someone to tell me that they loved me. But it never happened. After awhile shit fell apart between me and that one girl because she didn't seem at all interested in even talking to me.   So after that I decided to leave and go back living with my mom, it wasn't just me wanting to be closer to the person I hold dear to me, but it was also because my dad was being a complete asshole with the way I'd miss school somedays (he would lose it if I even miss one day of school) and it didn't help that even if I was sick, it was freezing cold, or the bike I use to ride to the bus was fucked up somehow. If I even missed 1 minute he'd lose it so I was under a lot of stress because of him. I went back with my mom just so I could be close to my now best friend, I had to leave a lot of my friends for her but to me it felt worth it. It was an up and down relationship but I still felt extremely close to her and even shared some of my personal issues with her. But she's changed since 8th grade, she's now more talkative and was out there with certain things. I didn't mind at all since I was her friend, but the problem came when she didn't really talk to me during school and only exclusively talked to me outside through texts or when I'm at her house. She considered me her brother because of how close we were and I considered her my sister (even though deep down I loved her). But the fact that she didn't talk to me during school and treated me like shit became a problem I had and every once in awhile I would lash out at her because of my problems, everytime it did happen she would call off the friendship but the next day I'd be quick to apologize for my stupidity. This ongoing cycle of me and her being friends, then an issue comes up/reappeared, argument, then apology happened over and over again. Until today... She finally said that she was 100% done with me and my bullshit.   I'm sorry for the long read but I wanted to tell you guys what led me to this point in my life, I'm a failure, lost cause, ugly, pathetic, outcast with no friends, no money, nothing redeeming about me. I've tried so much but nothing ever works out. I'm like 95% close to ending my life right now, I'm a burden to everyone I've ever known and no one wants anything to do with me. Everyone I talk to goes away in after awhile and it doesn't help that it's usually me that causes it to happen. I just can't handle anything anymore and I'm sorry but I've tried everything I could to make shit work out but eventually nothing worked out. I'm done and I cannot handle the fucking loneliness anymore. If anyone actually read through this whole thing then I commend you.   Goodbye."	sw

"Need some advice in a difficult situation I've got a close friend who is apparently contemplating suicide.  They're not threatening to do it *right now* - she's saying she's going to do it later this week because she's ""not in her right mind.""  The thing is, she's in a rough spot and we're afraid she might change her mind at any time.    Some background:  She's my partner's closest friend, but about a year ago her boyfriend - which is underselling it, they'd been together almost 20 years - began to become really abusive.  He got so bad that one time he came over to our house while she was here and threatened to kill my partner, then punched the glass out of our door.  The next time she came over he showed up in the morning and I had to run him off with an expandable baton, then as he was leaving my upstairs neighbor came out to see what was going and he pulled a knife, then threatened to kill her and her grand-daughter.  But she stuck with him.  Well, his health was deteriorating - in fact during that last confrontation he actually left his colostomy bag on our porch.  Well, he died a couple of days ago.  She's devastated.  Because he was doing his best to isolate her from everyone, she's pretty much alone, and she wants to stay that way.  She doesn't answer the phone - and only a small number of people even have her number.  She's gone dark on social media as well.  She's corresponding with my partner through text messages though - and a few people have been able to get in touch with her.  She's been presenting as coping pretty well to them, but we are seeing a different side of her.  She's been very adamant that she doesn't want to leave the apartment they lived in, and she's been pretty clear that she doesn't want anyone to come over there either.  Some of the people who have gone have had to end up leaving the things they brought for her outside the door.  She says that she's only telling us how she really feels because she trusts us not to call police, that kind of thing.  We're thinking of just going over there regardless.  ...but at the same time, we're pretty much the only people she trusts.  If we do something to betray that trust, and the outcome is *NOT* something that resolves her suicidal tendencies, then we may have just cut her only lifeline.  In this state (NC) with the kind of money that we - myself, partner, and the subject of this post - have (which is basically none) we don't trust the police et al to solve this issue.  If the only thing on the line were our relationship with her I wouldn't hesitate for an instant.  If I thought that she had someone else that she would contact if we burned this bridge I wouldn't be posting.  When it comes to these things, I've lost too many friends to not take action... but we're trapped.  If we go, we risk alienating her and it's likely she won't have anyone to talk to in the future about this kind of thing.  If we call for assistance (or really, tell *anyone* about this) the same issue exists.  If we respect her wishes, we have to continue texting with her and hoping that the texts keep coming and when they don't, we have good reason to think that maybe it's because there will never be any more of them.  Any help is greatly appreciated.  Thank you in advance, and thank you for helping all of the people like myself who come here."	sw
"Another Monday I'm sitting in the hallway of my high school. I'm suppose to be in the common room for lunch. I never go in there though. The school year is almost over and I haven't eaten lunch in there once. No one questions it. My teachers are always saying ""oh, I tried to find you during lunch but I never could"".  The hallway I'm in is the only one in the school that doesent have a security camera. It's funny because there's an exit door too. I think about just walking out. All the way. Past the parking lot. Walking onto the highway, and just laying there waiting for death. I use to have friends. Along time ago. It's just a distant memory. Now it's just unhealthy relationships. I never speak my mind with piers. It causes too much pain. Too much conflict. They don't care I don't care I use to get angry and frustrated. I used the analogy "" I wake up everyday just to bang my head against the wall"". Now I just don't care. It's like I've broken my brain from hitting my head against the wall too much. I'm tired.

I improved my style and I'm proud of myself.      One of my resolutions when starting the new school year last fall was to dress better.

For shoes it was getting new shoes cause I wear my shoes in till the soles come off and then some. So I bought some Vans and Converse with my first paycheck.

"The thoughts got to me, i almost did it.. before i broke down. Last night at about 2:25am, March 31st 2018 was the date where i lost all my will to live. I had certain things happen in my life recently that ended up getting the better of me and i wanted to just not be around anymore. Then the thoughts kicked in, i become a zombie. I had lost all train of thought and no other way out. Thinking about what i was about to do. All i could see was the knife, the tub, and my own wrists. I pictured it in my head like you would do if your going to jump from one rock to another and then just end up doing it. My mind and body were just put to the test and i feel like i failed it. I didn't even make it to the kitchen light before losing it. I called any close friend i could to try and talk with, while i was balling my eyes out and breathing heavily. No one picked up... I cant blame them since it was so late and we haven't really talked on the phone in a while. But for some reason i thought the better option was to leave this earth still. I finally caved and called that hotline thats suppose to help us. I kept remembering that song Logic had wrote, what i would see on Facebook on some one should always reach out to you, and how this hotline would help you. I called, some one picked up and all i heard was ""Hello?"". I responded with just sounds of tears and out of breath motions and heavy breathing. I told them what happened that night, why i wanted to do it and what pushed me so far to the edge.   For some odd reason i thought i would be talking with some one who would be more sincere and lovable and just kind. I kept thinking a woman who sounds like Miss buttersworth would pick up and continue to call me ""Sweetie"" or ""baby"" in a sweet southern accent. But no i got some one who didn't sound like that at all. Just some one who seemed like they were doing their job, well what they thought anyways. I talked about my problems and what got me leading up to this point but she kinda just kept sticking to one part of the story that i had mention. Like the whole part was so important and that was the reason i wanted to do this. I hear a yawn from her here and there like she was so eager to leave or go onto the next call. It felt like i didnt matter at all to this person and that it was just some bad joke.  I thought this would be a hotline for help, i thought i would get more or just help on places to go to or what i could do better. But instead was just told to sleep it off, tomorrows a new day, and just get some rest and not think about it. I felt numb and completely stupid at this point. Wasn't sure if i would even wanna tell my friends what had happened. What would they say about me? Would they think i was fucking bat shit crazy? Would everyone think i was fucking crazy? You hear this shit all the time on social media or on the news about reaching out for help, but all i got was a pat on the back and a shitty over used phrase like it would help me to go with my call. I wasn't thinking in my head that this person on the other line had to give a shit about me but i just felt like i would be talked out of it more.   Was i wrong to think this? Am i just being selfish again and not getting what i wanted? Should i have just called back? I couldn't sleep at all. I had some friends message me later about a facebook post i had written. All it said was ""I fucking hate my life"" and that was it. I figured people would just see it as an excuse for attention or just some emotional kid being too fragile. I just couldn't believe i had these thoughts run through my head. I was always the person to reach out to anyone who needed help, i was always the person to be there for anyone, and i was the one to always be the better person. But i caved, i fucking caved so bad and lost all of my will. I wasnt sure where else i could go or where else i could type all my feelings in one. This is my first Reddit post and its about suicide? Fuck, am i wrong to think all this?"	sw
"I'm gonna miss my friends when we all graduate A little backstory: I grew up in a poor family and I've been through more than one rough patch as a teenager. I got to pursue a higher education on grants, and I can say with full confidence that my time at college has been the best years of my life. I've learned so much, experienced new things, sharpened my skills, but best of all, I've made so many friends.  Yesterday my friends and I all got together to make General Tso's Stir Fry. I brought the ingredients, but everyone else helped in their own way. Some of them helped prepare the food, others brought utensils I was missing, and everyone kept a funny conversation going. The food turned out great, and we had so many ingredients left over that we decided to do it again today. I was writing about it in my journal after we finished cleaning up, and it made me realize just how much I'm going to miss them all once we're all done with school.  I've known them all since my second year, we moved into the same quad (cluster of rooms) together, and  I've been living with them for the past 3 years. I remember my roommate for two of those years would host tabletop RPGs for us like D&D, and they were even more fun than I ever could've imagined them. And anytime one of us was in a bind, we'd all be willing to jump up and help out. They're all like family to me now.  Some people say you don't know you're in the good old days until long after they're gone. But I'm over here tearing up because I know that I'm in the good old days, and I'm going to miss being here in college so much. Two of my friends are graduating this semester. The others still have at least a year to go, and I have one extra semester left.  So, has anyone else here ever been in the same boat? Made a tight-knit group of friends at college, then separated after graduation? What happened afterwards? How did you cope moving on?"	cc
"Been ignoring my (few) friends on social media every now and then when I want to be alone, is it a bad habbit? So basicly I don't like the idea of Messenger and Whatsapp much, I mean sometimes I just don't want to be contacted. And then I just ignore the messages, but after a while people start tagging you in messages, I really hate it. Why can't not answering be a sign of 'I just don't like to talk right now' instead of 'he must have forgotten I sended something, I will send 100 more'. I wish there was an option on Messenger or Whatsapp where you could change your status, just like on MSN back in the days. Most of my friends know I don't answer always straight ahead, but when they keep reminding me to read their messages and I keep ignoring it, I feel like I am a bad person/friend. Is it so abnormal to just wait to anwser for a few days \( somtimes it can take more than a week :D\)?"	cc

"Too many The sixth suicide just happened at my high school this year. There were another three that happened in December. Nobody is glorifying it, nobody even knows unless they ask around or go to the funerals. It’s starting to sound like the norm, another hanging, an OD. hell, one kid floored it into the back of a school bus. I knew most of them, seen them around. It’s very different hearing of a death, then seeing the empty seat right next to you. I’ve made two attempts on my life, and I remember feeling so alone and empty inside. I still do sometimes. Every time I hear what these kids are going through, and how alone they feel, all I can think is “we were here ready to listen” unfortunately it’s not that simple. We all know how severely alienating this disease is. We all know how ugly it is. And there’s no end in sight. I don’t know what to do other than keep living. Every time one of my friends ends it, it strengthens my resolve to keep going. To survive for them, and everyone else who is struggling to prove that this monster can be killed, if not at least tamed. At first I’m angry at them, then at their circumstances. Suicide has already taken so much away from me, and I refuse to give it the satisfaction of giving up. The grim reaper will have one hell of a time getting to me, you can be sure of that. "	sw

Sports issues Me and my freind who are both in eigth grade but don't go to the same school. I only get to see him while playing sports. Well the highschool was short on goalies and he got moved up to jv. I am a defender and they didn't need any of those. So I have to stick on the 8th grade team. Just bummed i don't get to see him.

"It's not an option... ..but I keep turning to the idea again and again. I've had almost twenty years where I have considered suicide as an option. I've just started to try to take it off the table but the idea persists. I'm thinking about it right now...I'm not depressed...I'm intensely anxious, I'm trying to calm myself, to pull out of it, but one calming thought isn't a thought I should be entertaining - I can quit if things are bad.   I don't WANT to be thinking this. I know it shouldn't be an option. I know what I have to do if I start going for the optionless option.   I am calming a little but not really...I'm dissociating.

"Sort of a silly thing to be sad about. Today I was planning on buying a new sketch book (a really big one) and a new set of pencils to start a little project I have in mind, but i realized I needed to put gas in to go anywhere. After paying my phone bill and putting gas, I’ve got nothing left to get my art supplies and it kinda bummed me down when I was planning my expenses next month and wondering if I could get the stuff then.   Gotta count my blessings I guess. At least I have a working car to get me from home to school. It’s a bit vain to be sad about not being able to buy art supplies I know, but it’s just weird. It felt like a very grown up thing to do: get the stuff I need, wonder if I’ll be able to get the stuff I want later. "	cc
"Hey, I could use some help with some ideas. I'm a Swedish student and I'm going the second to last year of my school until I graduate, and we are currently preparing for a big research project that's going to happen the last year.   For this project we get to choose what to do, what subject and what we are researching. I chose to do something with physics but my ideas so far have been terrible and I'm getting kind of desperate. Do any of you guys have any ideas on what me and my mates can research and measure? Preferably nothing to complex but still somewhat intermediate.

"Social anxiety People often think that I’m standoffish and rude because of my social anxiety and just my awkwardness in general. The only people I can talk to and interact with normally are people that I’ve known for 5+ years and even then it’s like a barrier is there.   My friend once made me meet someone new and I literally put a blanket over my head because I was too anxious and felt so uncomfortable even though they were welcoming and paid no mind to my odd behavior.   I also have a hard time looking people in the eye when we’re speaking and physical contact is a definite no. No handshakes or hugs, etc.   Anyway, I’m just wondering if anyone else is the same way, or if you once were - and how you moved on from it. "	cc
"Do any of you guys know about the ""quesadilla con o sin queso"" thing that we have in Mexico? For starters, we have this thing in the *CDMX* and the *Estado de México* that usually bugs other mexicans. The thing is, in most restaurants and street food stands in México, we have a very popular and characteristic dish called a *quesadilla*. The thing is, in the *CDMX* and the *Estado*, we serve them with a lot of different fillings, such as *chorizo*, *chicharrón prensado*, chicken, etc., whereas in most of Mexico *quesadillas* are *always* filled ***with*** cheese and **very** occasionally with something else. That's the thing that bugs most outsiders and some *capitalinos*; basically, the debate divides in ""las quesadillas a huevo llevan queso"" (that is, ""if it doesn't have cheese, it ***absolutely cannot***  be a *quesadilla*) and ""las quesadillas no siempre llevan queso"" (""it doesn't ***necessarily*** needs cheese to be a quesadilla"").  I'm using that much emphasis since the divide is kinda strong and both sides are very stubborn to each other.  I'm just really curious as to know how much do people in the USA (insert generic ""America is a continent"" comment here) and other english-speaking countries know about our culture. This isn't as much of an important part to it; it's more of a perk than an actual, serious debate, but I kinda wanted to know if you've heard of it. And if you had, what side are you on and why?  Edit: Para los mexicanos que vean este post: no se tiren arena. ***Parfavar***. Yo no vine aquí a levantar una tormenta de arena, y ustedes tampoco deberían. "	cc
"Should I let my girlfriend win? My girlfriend and I don’t go to the same school so we’re not close, in distance but no too far either.

"I just need a little bit of empathy and someone to listen to me I feel alone. It's a painful empty feeling in my chest and I've already been trough so much pain. I feel like everybody lets me down. From my dad who abused me in pretty much anyway possible. The police not looking for evidence of said abuse, because they wouldn't believe my mom. Then my mother and brother telling me to shut up when I would cry. Telling me I was overdoing it. Now my boyfriend telling me suddenly he can't be there for me, though he might sometime in the future.   I just can't take being hurt anymore. I just need to get away. Or I guess, be supported. But it seems like an endless chase for empathy I either don't deserve or don't know how to ask for. I'm in therapy, but it's not enough. I can't trust anymore. "	sw
"Why am I such a fucking idiot I could've just gone out without them even noticing anything was wrong. But no. I blew it.   Wenseday: I was angry at my mom. One of the daily fights I get in with her. I'm 30 minutes late to school and I have a migraine. I'm really pissed. So I lose control and write several poems about mass murderers, specifically Jeffery Dahmer, Ted bundy, etc . I read one out loud. Don't ask me why I did something so retarded. Anyway, I get sent to the principle. She says she's not going to punish me, but show my parents who were having a meeting with her tommorow (I've been diagnosed with depression by a doctor and my parents/school know). I told her my parents are going to get fucking pissed. She doesn't care. None of them do. Absolutely no one in that fucking school feels a thing about me other than disappointment and annoyance. They'd tell you otherwise. They're lying   Thursday: Some of the anger turns into sadness. By 5th period, I'm not functioning enough to think well. I cut right in the middle of class, and get blood all over my test. Teacher sends me to office. They tell me that I have to go with my mom, instead of my dad who I would much rather prefer, or they're going to call an ambulence. I've told them she's going to make it worse, but they don't care. She drags me to the hospital, and I wait 8 hours to go home and finally get some sleep I can never get, due to school starting early and me staying at my grandmas an hour away.   Friday: My mom lies and tells me some people from the hospital are coming and I have to go to her place. I tell her I don't want to, but she threatens enough so I can't bother to argue anymore. They never come. This leads to now. I honestly feel like I would kill myself if I had the chance. My mom keeps making it worse, and she won't let me get away from her. I hate everyone at school. Edgy, I know. But It's true.  I feel like doing something. Like sneaking into the woods and hanging myself. But I know I'm not going to do it. I'm going to keep sleeping all day, bottling up my feelings, and doing something stupid which fucks up my life for a few weeks. The cycle won't stop. I just want it to stop. I either want to kill myself, or turn my life around. Both seem like too much effort."	sw
I have about a week before I get my first tattoo and I want to make sure it’s the right thing. I’ve always held off because I don’t want to get a tattoo that I regret. But recently it came to me that there’s two things I will always stand for and I may as well get a tattoo based on them if I’m going to get one. I’m almost 30 and I’m pretty sure this is what I want to do. It’s a half sleeve so I know for sure what I’m getting the first session but I’m still undecided about what I want to add the second session so I’m still thinking on that part.   I’m the kind of person that tends to overthink things so I Obsess about one thing at a time and won’t stop thinking about it until I know I’m going to do it the right way. Basically I don’t like to screw up.  Also I’ve researched tattoos online and one thing that scares me is that apparently some tattoo ink can get absorbed into your lymph nodes. There’s no known side effect of this but so many people have one and I never hear of any issues regarding this. So I don’t know how to feel about that.  Most people would probably just say hey I want this tattoo and go get it but I can’t do that. I need to know this is the right thing and I don’t have anyone who will talk with me about this without thinking I’m a weirdo. 	cc

Did anyone else have a hobby they enjoyed when you were younger but ended up dropping it for one reason or another and are trying to get back into it at the present? I'm 24 and in my last year of University studying History at the moment but despite my long post I love history still and hopefully if I make it through I'll start my PGCE.   Yet when I was younger during Secondary school I used to love drawing (though I wasn't great) yet what put me off pursing it further was when I asked the art teacher if based on my drawings I could pick the art course as a option and she flat out said my art wasn't good enough to do that.   After that I just gradually lost motivation to draw which in the end was on me as I could have kept trying to improve on my own but that hit my hard at the time.  Only this year I've been trying to get back into the swing of drawing again although it's pretty awful naturally after not drawing in years and I don't have as much time to work on it.  To be honest what brought this post on was the fact that I see lots of drawing posts on different sub reddits about how they have practised over the years when they were younger and are now great which is only natural but I don't often see many posts about people who started(or restarted) late with a hobby.   Doesn't have to be drawing but anyone else people trying to get back into a hobby they gave up when they were younger? How are you finding it?  Once gain apologies for this long post/ramble I don't usually post topics in general but was just kinda curious about anyone else trying to get back into old hobbies and how it's going :)	cc
"I still have the ""lucky rock"" one of my customers gave me 10 years ago I've always been a collector of random things, but I used to love rocks and gems. Had the books, did the whole ""treasure hunting"" thing at the Cherokee reservations as a kid. Filled up a few tackle boxes from travelling around.  A decade later, those rocks long in storage, I was working with a customer. Sweet old lady who had these gems and rocks on her desk arranged just how she liked it. I was helping her move her personal stuff as she was retiring that week and she picked up one of her stones and placed it in my hand and said ""This has been my lucky rock, I want you to have it and give you what it gave me""   I didn't have the opportunity to ask the story behind it, because I got swept away shortly after. I stashed the stone in my pocket and it's been with me ever since.   I was cleaning my space just now and after wiping everything and placed it back on my monitor, because I'll keep this lucky rock around until I find someone else to pass it off to when I'm older and keep it alive."	cc

I'm 25 this year and I see some of them enjoying their life travelling with their circle of friends, some have their own families, some got their dream career and well, here I am stuck with days that have been a routine already. I like my job but there's nothing challenging about it. Sure, it's easy and I should not complain about it but sometimes I feel like asking myself, 'Is this really what you wanted? Don't you want to explore yourself more and know more things that you're capable of?' ... But I'm scared that if I leave my comfort zone, I won't be able to come back there again.

"Can't stand it when people mention how much they make/how much they're going to make at a job Not sure about everyone else, but in the 10 years I've been working so far, one thing I've noticed between both my friends and coworkers (oftentimes both) is that when someone gets a new job, they mention how much they're either expected to get paid, or how much they *are* getting paid.  And every time this happens, I feel like shit.  I feel this way because I've been working the same job for 5 1/2 years now, an easy but soul-crushing retail job where I only just now reached making $11/hour gross pay (net pay is probably closer to $8/hour after taxes and benefits, if that).

I don't think this would bother me as much if I were at least able to get an interview with a company for a job I want, and I've been applying to at least one job per day this year, but I've come up completely empty; the only companies that approached me were companies I didn't even apply to (one of them I loathe and the other two I don't think I'd be a good fit anyway).  But here I am, 28, still living with my parents, working the same job that I'm sick of, trying to get out but not getting the chance, and being reminded fairly regularly of how little money I'm making.  I just feel like I'm living life all wrong and can't find a way to dig myself out and actually feel like I'm either getting ahead or taking charge of my own life.  Not sure what to do.  I guess I'm just frustrated."	cc
"Dark thoughts 23m Hi, I'm not sure whats wrong with me. I've been having some pretty dark thoughts recently. I own a gun and found myself yesterday honestly entertaining the idea of offing myself. I honestly didn't trust myself. Something in my mind was urging me to ""just do it, let's see what it feels like, let's see what'll happen"" it feels like, my hands were getting really sweaty, and i started panicking because a part of me was legitimately considering it. Once I snapped out of it i was/still am to an extent terrified of MYSELF..  had to take it to my friends house and leave it there.   I've heard of ""call of the void"" before and that sounds like that's exactly what it is. I've been having this a lot more recently. And i think i might know why... See, I was always a bit of an anxious/depressed person, a recent cancer diagnosis (it was caught very early i will be fine) turned it into overdrive. I've been a mess lately and I've been having more destructive thoughts than usual. Thoughts of like ""you know you could straight up kill this person"" or ""you know you could just drive on the oncoming traffic full speed, why not"" every time i have thoughts like this I picture it happening, think of the aftermath/consequences, then I go into a mild panic attack. Feels like I'm going nuts.  I have a girlfriend, a great job, amazing family and I've never told them the thoughts that i have.  Where do i go for help? The episode with the gun... That was worse than hearing my diagnosis. not trusting myself for those 5 minutes terrify the shit out of me.  I've never been to a psychiatrist, or a therapist; and feel like i need help, this needs to NOT happen again. Does anyone have any advice on where i can start to heal? Should i see a psychiatrist first or a psychologist?    Thank you everyone."	sw
"Anyone else's beliefs/political views/outlook on life totally change in your 20s? I am about to be 25, and when I look at the past few years, my beliefs have radically changed. I used to be very conservative politically and now I lean much more to the left, even on issues I have always felt very strongly about. It wasn't college that made me this way, I just came to some of these realizations on my own. I also am strongly against having children (bio at least). This is another big change I've experienced.  It's weird because I can't help how I feel about certain things, but living in a very conservative southern state you get lots of flack for how you feel. I feel extremely alone and if I even admit how I truly feel then I get blasted for it. It sucks.  Anyone else radically change in your 20s?"	cc

"Ok, whose in the wrong here, in terms of logical and technical understanding, me or my mother? [Dishwasher] Ok, there are several programms/options a dishwasher has.  The key points in our discussion were: Engery expenditure (which results in costs/money) and time.  I explained my mother that just because you let a programm run the default time it needs, doesn't mean you are paying much more than if you would choose the ""shorten time"" option. That the contrary is actually the case. I presented her the following analogy:  ""Ok mom, imagine you go to Mrs. X to clean her place."" ""She asks you to be finished in one hour instead of the usual three. ""So to achieve the same results, your energy expenditure has to go up, much more than it would have during the regular three hours.""  She replied, ""I understand your point but it's a bit different with dishwasher"". She basically thinks that I misunderstood something. Anyway I replied ""Yes it is different, it depends on the programm, because each programm is intended to clean a different amount and type of dishes, however within the same programm, shortening the time does not reduce the energy expenditure and therefore not the costs.""

"Lazy Monday cooking After a pretty relaxing Easter weekend, I'm taking some time today to get some cooking done. So far I've made mango jam, cream of asparagus soup, roasted red peppers, and roasted eggplant. I might turn the eggplant into baba ganoush later and the red peppers will appear in my meals this week.

Nobody has conversations where they mention something because they “thought of me.” I’m good for helping everyone else get what they want and need but I’m practically invisible in every other aspect of my life.

"The greatest illusion of life: hope I’m sorry. I’m so sorry I’m the way I am. You don’t know how much you mean to me and I know it’s pathetic. You keep me sane, wanted, heard, but above all you listened to me.   For my whole life I’ve kept everything inside me because I had no one to express to. But for some reason I trusted you and confessed my entire life to you. All the shit moments, all the times I’ve broken down and cried. You listened to all of them. You listened when no one would.  You don’t know how much you mean to me.  You said you’re as fucked in the head as I am.  When we were still talking we built ourselves up. Not by saying everything is going to be okay but just by listening. Listening as word after word come out, years worth of pain and hopelessness. I was feeling hopeful, maybe something more. You listened when no one would, but you don’t know how much you mean to me.  Now you hate me. Ignoring me. Because I’m more fucked in the head than you are I guess. I always believed I would know when I’m losing my mind, when I’m going insane, so that maybe I can stop myself from doing dumb shit. But I realized staying insane is comforting, losing my mind is relieving. Losing you is losing myself also. I don’t know what to do anymore. I have no one to tell how shit my day went and try to make each other forget about it. You don’t know how much you mean to me.  The one thing I ask for you is to remember me at least. The little time we had together. At least I was apart of your life. That’s all that matters. Give coco my regards.  I’m sorry I wasn’t strong enough. I’m losing my mind and myself.

"Help, please. I'm 20, living with my bf and his parents, and was previously clean from self harm for a year. Previously. Last night I had a breakdown of sorts. I started thinking about where I see myself going in life, and the answer was.. nowhere. I haven't even finished highschool yet because I lack the motivation, i lose focus and I feel like a fucking failure for it. I don't want to work a dead end job, live in my shitty hometown and just scrape by. I'm so tired of this. I've been actively suicidal since I was 13, in and out of the hospital until I was 17 for numerous attempts and self harm, and because of it i missed out on a fuck ton of school and social interaction. I have social anxiety, so I'm sure the isolation was detremental to my development. I can't even make eye contact with the people close to me, I'm fucking awkward and can't hold conversation, and I feel like puking when people so much as glance at me for more than a second. I absolutely despise myself. Today i broke. I cut myself. And I feel numb. I don't want to tell my boyfriend (I'm not sure if it's because I'm scared he'll be angry at me, break up with me or pity me. I hate when people give me that look, like I'm some small hurt animal that they want to fix) but I'm not sure i can hide it from him. I don't wear clothes to bed often, so it would be odd for me to start after 3 years. I want to die. I've been thinking about it a lot, how much easier everybody's life would be without me burdening them. I don't want to go to the hospital. I hated my last therapist. I just want to end it. I'm unstable, useless, worthless. This sounds so fucking dumb but my childhood cat died last year and my heart is still broken. I miss her. I just want to be with her again. "	sw

"I just want to make it stop. All of the trivial stressors in my life- work, relationships, health, family-  People think these are what ail me, and that I’m overreacting. My life is a bit fucked up but in the scheme of things is something to be grateful for, and on the outside has all the answers laid out for me and the potential to be a functional human should be there. But what they don’t understand is none of that matters to me no matter how much I try. The goings on in my life itself, good or bad, are merely fodder for a greater pain. Just crumpled up newspapers thrown in the fire that burn up in a flash into smoldering ashes. The pain they inflict are just the sparks that spit from the bigger flame. The real problem is so much harder to understand than that, and impossible to explain- I try to grasp some form of sense out of reality, time, life, death, loneliness, love, good and evil- I am suffocating in an inferno of confusion, my flesh is burning alive inside and manifests as psychosomatic pain that leaves me incapacitated. I don’t know who I am, what I want or why I’m here, I can’t make any sense of the past, present, future- I’m lost, I’m lost, I don’t know if I’m truly alive or if anything or anyone is real. My thoughts make no sense. Other people make no sense. I can’t find any way to communicate my feelings. I feel like I’m in a straight jacket and locked in a metal box in the center of this fire that’s burning out of control. I can’t attach any meaning or feeling to anything. Everything is either pain or complete disconnection which is somehow even more painful. On the outside, I’m a whiny pest who is quietly losing my mind for no good reason, on the inside, I can’t stop screaming into the void of absurdity. One day I’m going to drink myself stupid, swallow a bottle of seroquel, slit my wrists and wander naked into the woods to bleed out in a river, and pray with all my might to no one that nothing exists for me after death. That’s the only thing I fear more than life itself. The only desire left inside of me is for silence. Nothing else gives me any relief from this agony. Please, God, give me silence. Give me a sign that if I die this will really be over and I won’t be condemned to any kind of continued consciousness. I need to be sure this is really the end. I can’t take it anymore.   "	sw
"Why should we live safe, standard lives? What I mean is why should I follow someone else's life plan? Graduate high school, go to college, get a job with a corporation and work a 9-5 job, marry someone, and have kids that will live the same life.  It seems so boring...

So why settle for a boring life??  I want to explore the world, see all the beautiful and amazing things on our planet, experience different cultures.   I know it would be hard to do and not very practical. I would have to give up material things, the gym, hobbies I have. I would have to give up my family. Anyone else feel this way?

"Daily Anxiety, Pains, And Suicidal Thoughts I feel so empty right now. I feel like I'm doing everything that leads to a healthier mind and body, but I still end up with the same results.  Every day I have bouts of anxiety or attacks at random. Whenever I start to get anxious, I do my best to notice that it's anxiety and just observe the thoughts. I accept them as much as I can. When things get to be too much, I use a CBT thought record to help reduce the attack significantly and It works. I meditate each day and do yoga each day. Yet, I still have physical pains that I know are produced by anxiety. (they go away when I'm calm and they never get worse) This morning, I was eating with my partner and my stomach started to feel discomfort and some nausea. It wasn't anything I hadn't eaten before.   Quick background: I had my gallbladder removed back in February because it stopped working. January was hell for me because I got really sick and lost 18 pounds in a month and doctors could not tell me what was wrong and why everything I ate made me feel sick. I had awful panic attacks daily.  So I was having thoughts such as: ""Is it happening again? Am I dying? Why can't my stomach function properly? Why won't this stop? Will I be at the doctor's all over again despite getting the all clear recently?""  I began crying and my partner gave me a hug and just held me and I felt better soon after. He went back to his house, and I'm feeling so low right now. I don't know what pains and sensations to report to my doctor about. They all come and go when they want. These panic attacks come at random and I don't know how to overcome them. I've done it once before through meditation, but it's back now. I am on medication for the major depression I had back in early 2017, but I'm not on anything for anxiety. I really don't want to add on another medication. The doctor referred me to a psychiatrist, but I can't afford it. (No insurance) I've been looking for a job and applying. Last week I scored 3 interviews after months of searching and two of them haven't called this weekend about the second interview and the third one is tomorrow. My parents will not pay for any of the psychiatric care. They are also a huge source of stress, so I don't talk to them. I feel like I can't function or handle stress. I cry at least once every day. I have suicidal thoughts every day. In my head, I know that things always get better. Despite knowing this, I still have suicidal thoughts.  Thank you for reading this.

Turn my negative energy into something positive!! Earlier today I phoned up my pharmacy to refill my prescriptions and for some reason they were having trouble putting it through and said I didn't have coverage or whatever. Now it's not really a huge deal I'll figure it out tomorrow however for some reason it put me I a really bad mood and I was super angry for no good reason.   Now usually I try to do something to change my mood like painting or going for a run so that I'm not marinating in anger all day or act like a jerk around people. It doesn't always help but most of the times it does.  Anyways today I remembered that I had promised to do a painting for one of my friends from work who is moving before she left. So I went and finished the piece over the last two hours and I've done a complete 180! In so happy now it's like the shit this morning didn't even happen.  I'm so happy that I channeled all that negative energy into making something positive and was able to swing my mood around! I'm also so excited to show to my friend!  It might seem like something little but I just really wanted to share it with everyone I could and talk about what other people do when they are feeling down that helps change your mood or mindset. I'm always looking for stuff to change that anger into something more positive so hit me up with what you do!	cc
"Endless guilt for teenage behaviour leads me to want to end it. I don't know why I'm doing this, but I don't feel like I can turn to anyone else.  I'm from the UK, and when I was 17 I was self-harming and falling into a depression. I had no direction at school, I wanted to be with a girl I had liked for years and years but it had never happened.   I then went out to hang out with a friend of mine because i was deeply lonely and pathetic. She was 3 years younger.  We kissed on a bench in a public park for a while, and i rested my hand on her leg.   We then ""went out"" at school for the next week, hanging out on the walk up to school from the train station, with at least 1 of her friends and people I knew from the train. Every interaction we had was always in a public space or at school. I never, ever, ever touched her or even hinted at doing anything beyond a kiss.  I called it off when I had a bit of a moment and realised that this could end up with me turning 18 in the not too distant future, and still being deeply hung up on the girl I truly cared for, who I then had a emotionally destructive relationshp with for a grand total of 5 weeks.  I get it if you think I am some sort of monster or freak. I feel like one, even all these years later.   And here I am. Every achievement in my life feels hollow, because I feel like a piece of scum not deserving of life. I barely feel like I can judge someone who did what the guy from brand new did.

"Opinions on having roommates and be courteous of one another So I am an early riser. So I like to get things done fairly early so I don’t have to worry about it later.

"I dont know what im doing I really dont know what im doing anymore. A little over a month ago my wife told me she was unhappy and that she wanted a divorce. A couple days later i moved out because it was awkward between us. I found out abfew days after that, that she had been talking to someone else for a while and that they are now dating (unoffically). She can tell me all she wants that she didnt leave me for him but i really so think thats the case.  Our anniversary was on the 13 of march which was the first day i attempted to kill myself. I drove to a secluded parking lot of an amusement park which is shut down until summer. I sat for three hours with a loaded gun in my hand, without the courage to actually pull the trigger. Since then ive tried more than 15 other times. There are several people who know that i want it to happen. Just recently i came forward to my dad, who yelled at me and took my gun away, as it was a present from him, and ive been keeping it in my car as im pretty much homeless at this point.  I have no one to talk to, and even if i did it doesnt make it any better, my ex now knows about me wanting to kill myself yet still refuses to talk to me. As of right now i plan on buying the biggest bottle of sleeping pills they have and consuming it all.

Once i have the courage.. i think ill finally get what i want.  Honestly, i think im only posting here to put it into words. No one else is listening and when people do, i dont want to listen back. I dont want to get better, i dont want to move on. I just want it to be done."	sw

"I just rocked a phone interview! (and here’s how I did it...) Am sitting alone after having just had a really good phone interview (they offered me the job on the spot) and just wanted to share both my happiness and tips on what helped me so it might help anyone else who might be in a similar situation.  I spent about 3-4 hours before the interview doing preparations.  I got 5 sheets of paper and put bold titles on the top of each: 1. About the organization and where the role fits in, 2. Duties and Accountabilities, 3. Selection Criteria, 4. Other Practical Examples, and 5. My Questions.  I then filled in information in my best handwriting on each sheet.  I used a notepad for scribbling down rough notes for each on a separate paper.  But the important thing was that I eventually wrote the good notes down by hand.  This because I read something about the learning process that things sink into your memory better when you write them by hand rather than type.  For the sheet 1. I bullet pointed everything relevant I could find in the job description / website, writing key words in red.  For sheets 2 and 3 (duties and selection criteria) I put what was listed in the job description bullet pointed down the left side of the paper (again highlighting key words) and then wrote how I fit each point with practical examples on the right side.  For sheet 4 I brainstormed other practical examples of topics that I guessed would probably come up in interview questions, like “common problems” and “innovations”, etc.  For sheet 5 I listed the questions I had.  I had all 5 sheets laid out in front of me (along with my CV and covering letter) when the phone interview started.  It went so well and in the end I actually barely looked at any of the information, but it was all readily available in my head during.  So it went smooth like butter.  I’ve never done this level of preparation before but I was really pleased with how it paid off and just thought I’d share it in case it could help any other job seekers out there!"	cc

"I finally bought a new laptop but not so sure how I feel about it My current laptop is over 5 1/2 years old. It was an expensive gamer laptop so it can still run many games on high settings (except for the most demanding ones). The laptop is technically still usable, and I probably will continue to use it to play games that are currently installed on it. However, it still has Windows 7 which will be phased out soon (don't get me started on trying to upgrade it to 10), it loads things super slowly, and the hard drive sometimes seems to mysteriously fill up without me doing anything (I get the low disk space prompt all the time). A couple years ago I had to go through the whole process of reformatting my laptop because it crapped out and wouldn't even boot Windows.  Still, I'm the type of person that hates to buy a newer model unless the older model isn't even usable anymore. Same thing for my phone and for my car - I didn't buy a new one until I literally had to tow my car to the dealership for engine overheating (among other things). I guess the reason why I bought a new laptop now is so I could be proactive about transferring to a new computer so it won't be as much of a hassle later on (and I'm getting tired of dealing with my current one), but there's still a part of me that feels like I should still try to squeeze as much out of my current laptop as I can, lol.  Anyone else feel this way about buying new stuff? How do you justify your purchases? I do have my impulsive/frivolous buys on occasion, but I've always been pretty careful with my money, so I often subscribe to the ""if I don't need it I don't buy it"" philosophy."	cc
"Just heard a song from 10 years ago It was [American Boy by Estelle Ft. Kanye West](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic5vxw3eijY) and the song of that summer.

"Ready to give up. I’ve thought about this a lot lately... I’m 19, male, and engaged to my beautiful fiancé T who is 20 F. And, I feel like I don’t have anything going for me. Ya I have a wedding and whatever, but, beyond that. I think I’m just making her life worse, I keep telling her she can leave me if she wants to, and that I wouldn’t blame her for doing so... but, I think she knows what’s going on because she always looks in my eyes with concern. I never actually communicate my feelings to her, because if I do end up taking my life I don’t want her to think it was her fault or that she could have stopped it. I have it planned out. There’s a bridge in the middle of my town with some big waterfalls, and, I think that’s how I’ll go. Jumping off the bridge... i don’t have a job, I rely on playing stupid concerts for the $30-70 pay they give out, and it usually just pays for a cigarette addiction...   T says I’m changing and it scares her. It hurts me to think that I scare her... I think she’s the only thing I have left, and that’s why I don’t do it. I hate seeing her cry or be in pain and, I don’t want that to be my fault that she’s hurting. Maybe I tell her it’s okay to leave me so I have nothing left to hold on to... I guess in a way, I’m holding onto a ledge and my fingers are starting to slip. I don’t know how much longer I can hold on for... but I’m close to breaking.  A little too close to breaking... -S"	sw

"Idk if it’s me or my meds My psych lowered one of my meds because I was doing really well but at the same time I felt like I wasn’t doing well. I just feel like things are slipping out of control. My bosses are abusive, my family is abusive, I was horribly abused by my sister’s friends and I think her new boyfriend may do the same, I had to switch all my doctors at the start of the year due to new health insurance so I don’t have a solid foundation with any of them yet, my separated husband just tells me to keep pushing forward which is what I did up until I was admitted to a mental hospital last year and I feel like I’m going to end up there again either by my own choice or because I may get low enough to try to hurt myself again. The only thing that’s stopping me is losing custody of my son but he’s only two and part of me keeps rationalizing that he won’t remember me or miss me because he’s too young. I just feel anxious all the time about everything and like everything is spinning out of control and I have no handle on any part of my life and I just want it all to end.

"Does anybody remember MP3Den.com? I think they were active from late 2002 through to 2007, but I guess that was just when I noticed they were gone. I remember back in 2003 I used to go on there to snag songs and burn them to disc so I could play them in the car when my mom drove me to school. My friends wanted in on it, so I started burning discs for them too (I charged them two bucks for an album so I wasn’t just throwing my money out). But for real though, does anybody remember this site at all? I remember the site looking two different ways. The first one had to have been around 2003-2004. It was stark white and there was a lot of content on screen. I believe the main thing on the page was songs the staff picked to be on the front page. Later on, around 2006, the site got a bit more dark and “modern”? Lots of red and black, which reflected the time period well enough, considering that was the whole “emo revival” era. The updates were always fun to look forward to, but as time went on they got pretty weird. One of the owners (there were five) made updates telling us what artists and albums he planned to upload to the site (I assume he was buying physical copies and then ripping them to his computer?), but I think he made an update saying he was ending that “service”. He said it was to make it more mysterious and to keep us on our toes, but I think it was because he wasn’t buying CDs as much anymore. I remember that one of owners of the site always got strangely personal with his posts, often telling us home details that were sort of TMI. As time went on, the updates got sort of infrequent and shorter. Eventually it just came down to changes he had in mind that he’d express in one word sentences, sorta bullet point style.   I think we started pissing off the main guy who updated by badgering him about the watermark on every single song. Like seriously, who does that? He did, and it was always a hassle to cut it out before putting it onto disc. Lots of users didn’t have the technical knowhow to splice it out, but the guy insisted it was important on keeping the “intellectual integrity of the site” (ironic, considering it was bootlegging, right?) I was young back then, so I definitely didn’t know how to remove them. Eventually I learned to more or less drown them out, and I’m sure those CDs I made, if any of them are still around, are riddled with that stupid, shitty techno watermark. I swear it’s almost ingrained in my mind nearly 15 years later. It said “www.mp3den.com, experience it”, as I recall. The voice was strange, and it was pretty obvious that it was pitch shifted down. It also wasn’t professional at all, and it was pretty obvious it was one of the owners who made it. I’m sure if you look hard enough, you could find songs on youtube with that same exact watermark. If you do, let me know!  The forums were always fun, I made a few friends on there. I became close friends with one of the owners, he was always really chill. Occasionally you’d have the people coming along and calling heresy on the whole site, shouting about how bootlegging was illegal, but they got banned pretty quickly. You’d also have some guys trying to advertise their own mp3 site, but they never got much attention. I remember a few times there were guys who wanted to put their own music onto the site and they immediately stopped responding once one of the owners pointed out that they wouldn’t be getting any royalties from it. One guy went so far as to make as many fake accounts as possible and spam the forums hating the site, but they all got banned and eventually he got tired of it.  Looking back on all this, the site seemed shady as hell, but I certainly had a lot of fun on it. I’d really appreciate it if anyone could give me more info, or even their possible memories of the site?"	cc

"I want to die so bad, but I'm afraid of the pain. I hate feeling fear. I hate being alive. I just want to be loved or something. I hate myself so much. I hate being trans. I'm sick of my mom pretending that I never came out to her. I'm sick of knowing my dad will disown and/or hurt me if I come out. I'm sick of being alive, but I'm so scared of the pain, and of giving up the one life I have. I know that might make it sound like I don't want to die, but does anybody? If I could choose between suicide and living a happy life, I'd choose the latter in a heartbeat. I don't want to be the next Leelah Alcorn, but being dead is the better of bad options. At least if I kill myself, it might ease somebody else's suffering. It might drive some trans girl or guy's parents to hate them a little less. I don't want to live like this. I won't be attractive. Even with people who would be okay dating a trans girl, having high functioning autism makes me impossible to love or relate to. I was dealt terrible cards with life. Out of the billions of people on this planet, I had to be one of the few that can't be happy with their gender. I only get to see my counselor once a month.  I'll be moving into school soon. Last time I was there, I thought I would be happier, being able to present how I wanted. But all it did was result in me being friendless and misgendered constantly. I want to kill myself, but I'm scared it'll hurt. And I only get one life, and I'm scared of giving that up. I already said it, but I don't want to die- I just feel like it's better out of what few options I have. I might just be writing this because I want attention, because maybe I'm hoping somebody can change my mind. But it doesn't get better. The longer I go without transitioning, the worse I get. The deeper my voice will get, the taller I'll grow, the more hair I'll grow. It gets worse, not better."	sw

"Please read this and think about it My life the last 5 months has basically been me trying to prove with my own life that there is a situation in which killing yourself is the appropriate thing to do.

I've masturbated incessantly. I haven't been able to leave the house without trying to pick up a hooker for a couple months. The day before my sisters wedding last week I went in my mom's room and tied a plastic bag over my head and took deep breaths for about 1-2 minutes just to see what would happen. I'm becoming a worse and worse person and I don't care enough to change myself. Last week my mom nearly choked to death in the middle of the night and I heard her and waited to see if anyone else was gonna hear her first. I waited like 2-3 seconds before going to try and help, just cause I'm so lazy and careless. And less than an hour after my mom nearly choked to death, I was watching porn and jerking off again. Now you tell me why I shouldn't kill myself. I don't care enough to change. Who knows what I'm capable of. I have a really bad temper and very violent thoughts. I have very strong sexual impulses. What if I become a serial killer or a serial rapist? I did all these things to myself and let myself reach this point. Isn't that proof enough that I don't deserve to be here? "	sw

"My Friend is Part of My Night Time Routine My friend and I (f) call each other every night before bed (98.7% of the time). We will talk until one or both of us fall asleep.

At this point, we normally have a verbal tennis match rally; going back and forth like we're battling for the title at Wimbledon. In some cases we agree to a compromise such as, I will read to him or make up a story. He likes listening to me talk (I have no idea why, I sound like a stale French baguette - crusty!). He normally falls asleep to me breathing or chatting away, but before doing this protests that he's not sleepy and that I should keep assaulting his ear drums with my strange conversations.    There was a time where I was unable to talk to him for a number of nights, when we finally talked again he commented on how it felt weird sleeping without me. He also added that he likes when I fall asleep on the phone to him but especially when we fall asleep together and wake up and continue talking. (I have unlimited minutes, otherwise these long conversations would not take place. I'm a broke student nurse.)   Calling each night is mandatory, after showering and brushing my teeth it's on the phone to my friend. I have to admit that after doing this for so long, I find it hard to sleep without talking to him. Strange right?!   Is it weird that we do this? Or is it more common than I'm aware of?

People don‘t even know I exist. I have no future. The last time I left my house was 9 months ago. My family abuses me, fuck, I even got raped when I was little. Everything just hurts so much. I never had friends/a girlfriend or anyone I could talk to. I lay in bed all day, if I‘m lucky I maybe even manage to force myself out of bed and sit in front of my PC.

"My dog just “flirted” with a cute guy in the bus Every time I travel with my dog she chooses one person to “flirt” with (basically she keeps looking at them and wagging her tail furiously every time they look back and if they’re close enough she tries to get to them to be pet).   This time she chose this guy who sat next to me on the bus. Luckily he thought my dog was super cute so we started talking a bit while he was petting my dog. I thought he was a very good looking guy and the whole time we were on the bus together I was thinking to myself ‘I should ask his name (and number?) so we can meet up some time’ but I’m an idiot and I’m shy so I didn’t ask.. Then he got out and he wished me safe travels and he waved to my dog (or me? Who knows) before he left.   It was so sad, my dog was completely confused and kept trying to look for him. I’m also a bit sad because I have no idea what his name is and I can’t find him in any way, so I probably won’t see him again.   It did make my day though, so it’s not a completely sad story :) And who knows, I might see him again some time!    Edit: Added a [picture](http://imgur.com/bhyenz7) of my goofy dog"	cc

"Does anyone else hate April Fool's Day? With April 1st coming up I'm really not looking forward to it. I personally can't stand it, it's basically ""don't trust anything anyone does or says day"". I'd prefer not to have to watch out for people playing jokes or pranks on me around every corner. Now it's weird, because I'm not opposed to being pranked in general(as long as it's not the idiotic, harmful ""internet style"" of pranks of course), but having a day that's pretty much dedicated to pranking takes away the point of it. Pranks are supposed to be unexpected and take people off guard, they lose effect if the person is on their guard all day expecting to be pranked, which is generally the case on April Fool's Day.

I'm so lonely, I don't have any friends that I can hang out with and I haven't been in a relationship for 4 years. I struggled with being bullied at university, so I locked myself in my room. I didn't talk to people for over five days and was constantly inside my own head.  It's sounds sad and weird, but I spend my time creating my own friends and relationships in my head to help me get through it all. I haven't had any friends for the past 4 years and when I do try to make some, I'm constantly conflicted because I struggle to get close to people. I hate moaning, whining and feeling sorry for myself but I'm at the point now where I want to just kill myself. I try and think it'll all get better but it never does. I'm never happy, my positive outlook is now constantly negative. No matter how hard I've tried losing weight, getting a better job, being more trusting and talkative, I just end up being the one who lands flat on their face.

"what should i do? A bit about me: I did extremely well academically in school, and got into a top university. I had things set for me. But shit happened, and I ended up with a criminal conviction. My future career is shit, because of that record. I may as well drop out of university as I won't get a job with a record.   Second, I'm the most anti-social guy you'll ever meet. During school, I never attended a dance, or social outing. I even skipped the semi-formal and then the formal the following year. (For the Americans here, a formal is like a prom.) Even when my mates arrange for one of their female friends to go as my date to social events at university, I create excuses and never show up. I just don't know how to communicate with people. Give me a job at a computer and I'll do it no problem. Give me an individual written ask to do at university, and it'll get done. But give me group work and I'm the most fucked up mong you'll ever meet. My interpersonal skills are dog shit.   I have't talked to a girl (with the exception of my sister and mom) face to face for like 5 years. (I went to a private catholic boys only school and I just never had much of a peer group. Apart from interacting at school and the rare weekend drinking session at a mates place, I never associated with anyone outside of the 6 close mates in my peer group.) As such, I've lived in isolation from girls for an incredibly long time, and literally have no clue of how to communicate with them.   To compound my already fucked up life I was diagnosed with ADHD and suffer from depression. The terms of my parole (12 months of parole due to my criminal conviction) state that I must seek psychological help. I've been there and done that. Psychologists are useless. I've begun seeing my old psychiatrist after a year of not seeing him. I hope I'll be able to use my ADHD condition to get back on Ritalin. (I was on it during high school and it made studying and life so much easier. Since I got off it, my life has gone downhill.)   I recognize that I need help. I come from a very well off family, and my parents have the attitude that money can solve everything. And they were right. I have a speech impediment, and chucking money at a speech therapist solved the problem. My poor grades in the first few years of high school were solved by chucking money at a private tutor. My ADHD was solved by chucking money at a psychiatrist and at Ritalin. With my parent's attitude, I feel I cannot get help from them.   What people don't  know is I've attempted suicide before. Thankfully a dog walker saw me throwing the noose around a tree to hang myself and tackled me. I ran off before he could call the police.   In my opinion, to get my life back on track, I must: (1) get back on Ritalin (this will become a reality next month); (2) get a real social life and start associating with people; and (3) stop being a mong (I can laugh about it now, but sometimes I feel like ending my life).   Any suggestions/comments on my plan?"	sw
"I might kill my self today I’m 29 and almost 30. Got my heart broken by my ex-gf in 2011. She started dating an ex- friend of mine in 2012 (he knew how much I was hurting)....went to psych ward, changed careers, moved to a new city to study music. 2017, became depressed with self doubt in music, 2 of my roommates (my best friends at the time), abandoned me and moved out without telling me...leaving me the financial burden. When I asked for one more month’s rent, they lied to my school about not feeling safe around me and got me banned.  Now I’m back in my hometown with an eating disorder..i’m overweight...can’t train in jiujitsu anymore...not doing music...no career...no confidence...working just part time  and I find out this week that my ex-gf and that ex-friend have been married for a year. I can’t handle this pain anymore.   I don’t have the strength to endure it. I know I shouldn’t let them bother me...but the truth is they have both hurt me so bad that I’ve broken.

"Would you share embarrassing tips to help acquaintances? I work in a professional environment as a traveling salesman kind of gig, and I have maybe 120 coworkers over 15 locations I see face to face once or twice a month as I do my rounds. I keep it very casual with them, my rank is ""higher"" than theirs but in a different space so I see them more as equals and encourage them to see me as one too so they aren't afraid to email me or call me to make a sale.  Anyways usually I talk to the younger guys about wardrobe trips, where to find sharper looking outfits for less, to the younger girls about how to deal with and deter harassment, and to everyone about career development in general, to break the ice and develop working relationships with them. As a result, they see me as this kind of coach figure right?  I recently lost a lot of weight (25 lb in 2 months) using a diet pill prescribed by a gynecologist (I'm male), referred by a close friend who also had similar success. I'm happy with the results and experience, and when i stopped taking the pill and saw the weight stayed down, I recommended it to my closest friends. Then i told my wife ""I cant wait to tell so and so at work about it"" and she told me not to say anything about the pill, because its kind of embarrassing and like ""cheating"" so it may damage my reputation at work. She made a compelling argument for it so i agreed since nobody had asked me so far anyway.  When I began to visit my locations after my little ""transformation"" had proven permanent without the pills, at first they didnt say anything, but then they began to comment how they were all shocked and asked how I did it, specially the heavier set people obviously. I just thanked them for the compliments and said work has been so busy Ive been skipping meals almost daily, and drinking a lot of water instead of soda to avoid stomach aches. This was all true and they saw it for themselves, and casually tested me about never seeing me eat in the past, so they bought it, and said at first they didn't want to ask because they didn't want to be inappropriate, and then offered me food lol. But it feels wrong, there's at least 3 co-workers with big events coming up in the summer and they would benefit so much from this pill, but in reality we aren't friends, just aquaintances, and while I would be happy if they spread the word so others can try it and see if it works, I am indeed worried my name would piggy back on it each time it's brought up."	cc

Why just why Hello everyone i have a few words  all that ive tried for months to get help for this crippling depression. Consoling and medicine everything even being open with my fiance. But nothing is working. To the point even while on the medicine I just want to die. Ive cut into my arm and face a few days ago and it was easy for me. My body is now allowing me to finnaly get closer to ending it all. Even with the supposeit love from my fiance and family i just want death. Im tired of the wicked world. Im tired of hate and im tired of living myself a loser to the world a faliure to society. Just a walking mistake. Nothing about me is good and I should just end it all like my body allowing me to. Maybe ill just goto to the walmart and buy some pain killers to get rid of the pain. Use all my medicine to make me emotionaless and allow the process to take full effect. Because living in this world of regret of hate of lonelyness is just getting harder and harder. Fuck should I even be alive right now? Should I have even gotten the help i did? Should I just do what my parents couldnt pull through with and just end my miserable life? What do I need to do? What should I do? Why am I still here? WHY AM I STILL HERE? A FAILURE TO THE MAX A DISGRACE OF A HUMAN JUST A CONPLEAT FOOL. JUST WHY. JUST FUCKING WHY CANT I DO IT? WHY CANT I JUST FINNALY DIE? WHY? 	sw
Learning to edit video brings back memories. In a previous post I talked about my son posting to YouTube and I thank everyone that commented. Now I'm addicted to editing all the videos I have taken because of it.  I'm not going to get into the boring details about editing. What I am going to talk about is all the memories I got to see when I started editing the videos. I got to see my daughter kiss a frog in hopes of turning it into a prince. I watched my son drop mentos in diet Coke. Basically I got to go through all my recorded memories.  So what kind of conversation do I expect to have with you. I would like you to go through your phones/computers and look at some old videos that you took that will make you smile and share the experience with me. Tell me what the video was and how it made you feel.  Lets share memories together.  	cc

Not even in the traditional sense, but throughout my entire life my friends , family, teachers, mentors, and bosses all believed I would amount to something greater than myself.  Pretty sure it's not happening before my 30th birthday looming around the corner. Or ever... I'm dead on the inside and have been for a while.   While I know that part of my behaviour as of late is to seek attention, I have a feeling it will never be enough. I will never be what I wanted to be. I'd rather drown than accept the mediocrity presented to me.   Seems pretty and childish to say this nonsense out loud. But here it is.

I actually like her art because it's so simple and cute.  And, while admit the particular comic of hers was not funny, it wasn't as horrible as the comments were saying.  It did make me think how people perceived a simple artstyle.   TL;dr simple art  means no talent?"	cc
"Don't know what is professional to do or not I sometimes don't know what is professional to do or not. Who else feels the same? For example, a college staff member had just contacted me and asked me to promote a French language exchange event. I am planning to translate the post into French and post this in a private Facebook group for French exchange students. Is it ok if I take a screenshot with what I've posted and share it with the college staff? Thanks."	cc
"Lost the will to continue I tried to get motivated every single day and hype up about what to do every morning.  But I just cannot keep up with 'Life'. It's making my mind blow up.  Okay, I realize that it's hard to dedicate oneself to keep up with life so I tone down a bit.  Now it seems I've tone down too hard and it is very very difficult to grasp back what you have in your life.  What is the purpose of life? Am I even needed in this world? I have upcoming exam in a month.  I don't think I can excel. I've been thinking of vanishing from this world.  Sometimes I think that I born in a wrong world.  Is it worth it? To go on with life?

"Today I held a baby for the first time It was so heavy! Only a few weeks old. It felt really weird seeing a baby this close. His facial features and movements were so random it made him look like some animatronic doll. How can a human be so small? And isn't it super weird that humans grow inside other humans? How is it possible that something this complex can be formed within 9 months? It made me a bit sad because I realized I'll never be able to hold my own baby like that because I wasn't born normal. It also made me wonder if I'll be a good uncle. I have social anxiety and generally, I have no idea how to behave around kids. It's like they're always scanning me, analyzing me and I feel like I should be some kind of a role model. "	cc

"I am sorry I can't take this anymore. For the past 2 years I have been struggling with depression, anxiety and constant suicidal thoughts, but today things became so much worse.  My overall problem is that I just feel so utterly worthless and pointless. I cannot describe how much I hate myself. I know for a fact that I am never going to achieve anything in life whatsoever. I am an unlikable person and because of that I don't have friends. Nobody likes me, and for a good reason. I am so annoying and negative. Sadly, I can't seem to find a way to fix myself and that is why I certainly won't achieve anything in a social aspect.  But that is not where it ends. I have no chance of success in terms of career aswell. I am so stupid. I have no talent. When I was younger people used to tell me that I am good at math and physics and naturally I started believing them. I thought my life's purpose was to become a scientist one day. I was so naive. 2 years ago I realized that they all lied to me. I was never even mediocre in that field. Yeah, I won prizes on a few competitions, but for me that was sheer luck. I have never deserved them.   The situation became a lot worse today. I am on a competition again feeling like shit, because I know that I failed once again. My stupidity started becoming apparent. I feel worse than I ever have. I haven't eaten anything today. I am basically living on self-hate right now. I can't get out of the bed in the hotel room. The good thing is that my room is on the 16th floor. Maybe I will finally get the courage to finally jump and end all of my pain. I have everything prepared. What makes things worse is that I have told all these things to a girl that was concerned because my depression became more visible recently and is on the same competition and she knows that I failed, but she doesn't seem to care at all. She was telling me about how much she cared and how everybody would miss me if I were to kill myself, but now it seems like she doesn't care at all. I completely understand her, but it still breaks my heart and it hurts so much.  I am sorry that this post turned out to be such a mess. I just needed to vent because all these thoughts have been killing me from the inside."	sw

"I'm worried that my girlfriend is going to kill herself. Were both 16, been going out about 4 months. She was in my house last week when I noticed scars on her upper arm, I played it off but called her that night to talk about it.  What I gathered is her mother has depression and she sometimes has these freak attacks, from what I know she doesn't hurt her but she does scare her and i hate that, she also has 2 younger brothers and a step dad living in the house. The scars looked old so I wasn't too worried.   Yesterday she hadn't text me from 4pm to 9pm so I knew something was up, I finally got it out of her, her mother had one of these freak attacks and she went into her bedroom and tried to OD. Her mother came in in hysterics saying she's gonna call the police and all that.  I spent the whole night crying but she assured me she wasn't in the right mindset and that she won't do it again, I also asked out of interest when the last time she cut was and she said last week but it was the first time in a year.  I love her with everything I have in me and I'm just afraid that one day I will get a call telling me she passed.  Also to note her real dad killed himself when she was 18 months, and she's going to Counselling for that."	sw
"I know how to do it now One failed past attempt. Constant envisionings of how it will go. Next time I'm confident.  1. Will quickly drink close to 1 liter of whiskey (numb pain and inhibitions); 2. Will partially fill bath with water and sit in it; 3. Wrap belt around something then yank at it with mouth; 4. Blindfold eyes; 5. Wield carpet knife, and slice wrists deeply open; 6. Bleed out into bathtub.  7. Fin.   I'll prepare notes whilst sober, reminding me not to contact anyone once I'm drunk. The flat/apartment will be empty. If the carpet knife doesn't work I may break a glass or bottle and use that.  All's well I'll have completed this before Friday 13th. "	sw
"I think this is it I don't normally threaten to kill myself or say that I'm going to, but I think the time has finally come. Life is just so hard and everything hurts so much and I just can't take it anymore. There's a bridge a couple blocks from my place and I think within the next hour or two I'll be little more than a smudge on the sidewalk. I tried to get therapy but after multiple failed attempts just to set up an appointment I give up. Don't tell me it'll get better its been this way for probably half my lifetime and only gotten worse, so if it ever actually does get better life has a pretty fucked up sense of humor. I have family and friends but I just feel so alone, I'm broken and I can't even bring myself to open up about it. I'm putting a note in my inside pocket that I think has enough to satisfy all of my closest friends/family and while I know nothing will ever be enough hopefully my letter will mean something. I don't want this to be goodbye but everything must come to an end, some things just a little faster than others. "	sw
"Contemplating I've been thinking about death and dying for some time now, sometimes even taking my life, but until recently I haven't actually seriously thought about it. I always thought that I don't have that in me. However, last few days were the worst ever. Last night I fell asleep trying to finally make my mind and decide to go through with it.  I feel like I'm a burden to everyone and whatever I do I mess things up. I've started seeing a therapist last week, but since my sisters give me money for the guy, it feels even worse. They were always my biggest support and I just dont want to hold them back anymore. The more I think about it, I'm more certain about doing it. I couldn't ask for a better life then I have right now, and reading some post here and listening to some peoples life stories makes me feel so ashamed, but fuck im so misserable all the time."	sw
"Every single goddamn thing wrong in my life This is a very long jumble of text. I just feel like my whole life, things have just built on top of each other. I don't even think a single therapist has heard all of the shit I think about. I feel like everything in my life haunts me. And nobody takes it seriously because I need to hit rock bottom first. I don't seem like I need help because I have gotten okay at covering it up. But people around me know I feel this way. It just seems like I am not broken enough for help. But I am. I grew up in a family of four. My parents are immigrants. I have an older brother. He has severe autism and I think my dad expects me to take care of him after they are gone. I can barely take care of myself and I want to move out of the area which I could not with my brother. I don't know how I would hold down a job yet pay someone to take care of him and take care of myself. It means the rest of my life would be dedicated to my brother, not me. I couldn't get married. I am already scared to have kids in case they are autistic. The cultural gap in my family is hard. My mom struggling with bipolar disorder, anxiety, and depression while insisting on no treatment meant hell for my childhood. 7 year old me spilling a glass of milk meant I got screamed at for the rest of the day. Banshee screaming about how I am a waste of space, stupid, worthless, etc. This goes on for hours in stages. If you say anything, it starts again. My mom has threatened my dad with a knife. She refuses to take any medication. In one of her episodes, she took me and my autistic brother to a homeless shelter because she was convinced my dad was evil. My dad said he went after her as soon as he could but I think part of him wanted to just leave us there. I always prayed for the day my parents would get divorced. They were toxic for each other. My dad has severe anger issues. It just worsened throughout the course of my life. One time, he went to visit his family in India. I was seven and my mom was getting incredibly upset. She broke off a drawer in the kitchen and threatened to hit me with it, nudging it on my shoulder. I called 911 crying. The police officers came. My mom acted somewhat normal but said I was misbehaving. The drawer was on the ground, broken off. They said it was my fault because I misbehaved. They asked if my severely autistic brother was okay. And in that decision I made a choice. Because I heard what happens to people like my brother in the system. And my parents had money. She didn't hurt my brother but I realized that what my brother could potentially go through much worse in the governmental system. They asked if I had anywhere else to stay. I said no. They told me to go upstairs and lock myself there and gave me their number in case she did it again. I called my dad. All he said was ""did it work? Can we try that next time she is upset?"" Never asked if I was okay. I spent that weekend in fear. Just glares, snotty whispers, etc. Whenever I received less than an A, my mom would ignore me. After two days, she would start screaming. That would be a sigh of relief because it meant she would love me again by the end of the week. If she didn't, I was more worried. There were weekly arguments in my house between my parents. They would tell me to go upstairs and ignore them but I would foolishly ask them to stop. They did not care. They only cared about screaming at each other. My dad hates my mom but still cares about her. She had an abusive childhood and the alternative to her staying in our lives would be to be in a mental institution with stigma because she would be a divorced woman according to Indian society even though we live in America. My brother's autism means he can't say I love you. He wouldn't even know if I died. He has so many violent tantrums. He just hits himself repeatedly. He screams like a toddler except he's much much older. There have been so many nights in my life where I didn't sleep. All my grandparents passed away by the time I was 18 and a family friend. Those losses hit me hard. I've had anxiety for most of my life. I rarely socialized with people because my parents did not have time with me because of my brother. I was a freak. I got depression in 10th grade. My perfect record as a student was gone after that and I lost all motivation. My family in India thinks of my family as a black sheep so they all dislike me because I suffer from mental illness along with our family. They judge us but they haven't had to deal with mental illness. I mean who are they to judge. We went to India to see them, me and my father, and my uncle drunkenly said no one wanted you guys here but I convinced them to let you come. I've never felt so embarrassed in my life. We still had another week we were with them. My friend got raped when she was in college. I think she might hate me secretly. She had a girl she knew come over and they both got drunk. The other girl started puking and my friend started panicking. I told her to call two people she knew there. They didn't pick up and she said she was going to ask her neighbor across the hall for help. I didn't think twice and I said sure if you know him and you think he will help. She started calling me the next morning but I was tired of talking to her while she was drunk. She told me the next morning that she was raped by him. I've felt like scum ever since. Because I should have told her not to go. And my father had open heart surgery my senior year of high school. Just when I thought things would be going okay, I had to become an adult. I was depressed. Isolated. Barely any family came to help and I was seventeen. My uncle in the US came once a week to check in but no one was at the house full time. My mom was convinced my dad was faking and refused to help me or take responsibility. I started grocery shopping, driving my autistic brother to doctor's appointments, visiting my father at the hospital or wherever he was, I went to my part time job, and I started missing school. I would go in the morning, leave, and come back at the end of the day so it wouldn't count as an absence but an early dismissal. The attendance ladies knew me by name. My schoolwork started piling up. I couldn't see my friends because I had to be on call for my father or stay at the house for my mentally ill mother and brother. My dad had angry outbursts in public all the time but I was the one cleaning up the mess after him, convincing them he was harmless instead of a psycho. We also argue a lot. He tries to control me. He acts like he doesn't but he is slightly misyogynist. And he is unbelievably full of himself and at times displays little sympathy. He got so annoyed at me once while he was driving he hit me in the mouth while I had braces. It started bleeding so I screamed at him to take me to an ER because I was scared. He started arguing with me another day and I accidentally hit him between his eyes with a phone because I was trying to defend myself. I felt guilty hurting him and felt awful. I was just scared. I think I became sort of a monster. I started screaming and getting upset all the time. I would threaten violence or get very physical because I felt it was the only way to survive. On the day of my graduation, my dad and mom started screaming so I left for graduation in tears. My dad went because my friend's dad offered to drive him. He left halfway through and I waited half an hour afterwards to see if he would show up to congragulate me. He ended up going to dinner with the other dad and asked if I wanted to join him. All those empty promises from multiple family members saying earlier in my life that they would come stung. I ended up going to a school I wasn't going to go to because my dad thought it was more prestigious and it was closeish to home that I would be able to check up on the family. I hate it here. And I was so depressed and going home my first year, I failed to make friends. I am so lonely. And my dad said I could leave but then lied and said he didn't mean it so here I am in year 2. Still barely talk to anyone. My life should have been getting better, not getting worse. Now I can barely take showers. I don't have any motivation. I wasted two years of my life. My aunt and uncle live near me but they only talk when they need something. I have a car on campus. So they ask if I am going home one weekend to pick up some things. Or if could drive them to Walmart. Or if I can help them move. They left so late from their old apartment they slept in my dorm room so they wouldn't sleep in the lobby because I offered. But I know what they think of me. Because they never call otherwise. They claim it's because they do not want to disturb me but they know I don't have any friends. They told the people they were staying with that I wasn't their niece but I was a student driving them. I waited for an hr in the car eating fast food while they were packing up because I was only a student. I never even meet the people they are staying with. I sleep in a pile of trash everyday on my bed. Sometimes I don't sleep. Sometimes I sleep the whole day. Sometimes I miss all my classes. I wanted a sense of normalcy and instead I got this. I told 3 of my friends that I felt hopeless. But none of them take me seriously. I had one therapist tell me that I probably will not commit suicide so why bother talking about it. I told another at college but she said I am resistant to change and in that moment she was my last hope. I almost bought charcoal to kill myself but instead I cried the whole day and missed my classes instead. I am tired of keeping up this fake happy facade. I was only doing it for my brother. But it's getting too much now. I am doing all of the things you are supposed to do but it never seems like enough. "	sw
"Interacting with Parents? Hi! I don't usually post on Reddit, but I think I will seek the advice of friendly internet strangers today.  I've been having some trouble with my parents; more specifically, them giving me more freedom with various aspects of my life.  Usually, they're pretty cool with this kind of thing, like if I wanted to go out with friends, but with technology, they have this stigma.  In particular, I want more freedom with my phone, or at least the ability to keep it in my room at night.  They have their own reasons for not letting me, but this policy was put into place a few years ago (when, truthfully, I wasn't getting enough sleep).  Now, I know the value of sleep, but I just wish they weren't so on top of me about when I do go to sleep or wake up.  Additionally, their attitude that it's improper to text in bed is a bit archaic to me.  I certainly understand their point of view but I just think it's a new age now and... why does it matter if I text at my desk or in bed?  My bed is way comfier than my chair.  I know this will sound really entitled/spoiled, but I just wish they cared less about me and what I do.  I want it to be my choice whether I'm going to be horribly sleep-deprived the next day or get a healthy amount of sleep.  I want to choose these kinds of things.  And I wish that changing a ""policy"" like this (no phones in the room when you go to sleep) wasn't like pulling teeth every single time.  I'm going to be going to college soon (I'm a junior now), so I feel like giving me more freedom isn't too much to ask for at this point.  Sorry if I forgot any key details, as I didn't want this post to get too long, but feel free to ask questions in the comments!  I'll reply as fast as I can.  I would like some advice on how to deal with this situation, especially if there are any parents of teenage kids reading this."	cc

Well tonight it is because,for the first time in my 17 year of life, my father has refused to hug me goodnight. He was away for almost all of my childhood until I was 12, and I've always softness of subconsciously wanted to make him happy I guess, and I've always tried to make his life easier. Tonight I came out to him as bisexual, and I tried to give him a hug goodnight to try and make the night have a good happy ending, burn he didn't believe hug me back. I could tell he didn't but want to touch me or be near me and I feel awful.

Now I'm sitting with here after getting my girlfriend taken away. To make matters worse, no college wants me. I know you might say, this is silly, just work harder. But, I don't think I can. No one looks at me and sees me as suicidal. But I need to put in so much effort just to wake up and go to school. Every little thing all of a sudden just becomes 1000x harder.

"Cancer and Autism and ruining me Alright , so where do I start? Well first of im a 16 year old boy with high functioning autism since birth. Im currentlyy 153 centimeters , which makes me a center of bullying. I am currently in grade 11 and have been bullied ever since grade 6. There wasnt a single year where I didnt visit the school director and/or counsellor because of me getting bullied. Nothing changed that I even had to move schools. Its highly noticeable I had cancer due to the multiple scars on my head, my height being another point of my bullying. I hate myself. I cry almost every day because no one understands me , in fact im crying right now. I dont know what to do , I am embarassed of having had cancer, specifically I had brain cancer. Since birth I was in hostpital till the age of 3. When I turned 8 it returned but was able to be controlled. I hate myself so much I dont care if it returns i would die any day of the week . I used to have a twin brother at birth but he sadly didnt make it (due to the cancer killing him which does make me sad , I wish I would have died not him) A small background story, when I was born the doctors said everythings fine, only my parents knew it wasnt. Uncle? Aunt ? Everything bullshit they always told my parents that Im not worth it, Ill never be normal I shouldnt deserve to ruin their life. Only my parents believed in me. And the only ones right now to. I have no family except them, and when they are gone, my family is gone. I managed to enter hospital a day before it 'would be to late' according to doctors but I wished it was to late!! I feel like I ruined my parents life, their family and they sold their house and everything for me to be alive because the health insurance didnt want to anymore. My mom almost got sentenced to prison for life due to illegal cancer treatment in Germany (so we went to Asia to do it but due to my german citizenship she almost lost everything for me to live) . I cant stop crying knowing what my parents did for me: Now to my autism, first of I dont have the autism where I cant really control myself. I can like i dont scream or so. However autism is difficult, I feel left out from everyone and everything. Even if I regonize it and remind myself of it,I will still struggle to speak and so on without even noticing. No one understands how I struggle with Autism everyday, especially with all the jokes people make about it or people with it ; I always hide my autism because I hate it. Im embarassed.  Lastly my height, nothing that can be done. Doctors said hormones impossible now its to late. Before the risk is to high I get cancer again and if I do they will end up in jail and my parents aswell. I will always be small. I wake up everyday thinking why I cant be like others. I just want to be taller. Like normal people. But im not normal. And no one accepts that. As said before it does cause alot of bullying the older I get.  Not trying to trigger , but I just dont commit suicide because I believe in god. And that he forbids it because there are millions in even worse situations. Normal people at age 10 do what? Well Im sure they didnt try to stick a knife into their chest to kill themself. (I remember exactly taking the knife it just the pain that stopped me) I legit dont know anymore. I cry for years , I know im not normal and not even my family accepts that. Its fine. I just want to die but my parents did all this for me I cant. Whats the chance of all this : cancer , high functioning autism and so small. wow . Im a burden and a mistake in this life I just want to die thats it.  I can atleast be thankful for me talking and walking, because the doctors never thought I will be able to do that. Heck I could just walk at 6 and overcame full blindness at 5 . Right now I have a lazy eye which does ruin me alot aswell. Efforts to fix it for 3 years proved unsuccessful. Does anyone understand me? Anyone , please? "	sw

Remember those white oblong ""vegetables""? They entered through my kisses and slid down the voice of reason. They entered all at once, 36 times if I can last remember.  My tummy aches darkness. My arms, they tremble. I tire the day and what is in store for me.   I guess you were right all along. You are the one for me. I remember the words you told me: ""You're beautiful"". You always knew how to treat me. Not once did you ignore me. It was always I who had ignored you.   Well, darkness my old friend, I welcome you back into my life. Just promise me. Promise me that this time you'll turn off the gravity so that I may finally be free?  Love, miah"	sw

Coming home Moved home recently after 7(ish) years of living away. Think it might just be the worst decision I have ever made. I now have constant reminders how everyone’s lives have moved on without me and how I am now just a burden to them...a dark cloud clinging to them which they feel too guilty to get rid of.

"I will watch my body wither away like that of a wildflower I plan to disappear one day. And when I do, it’ll be a sunny day. A sunny day where I go visit a tiny, undiscovered meadow outside of town and sit there for hours. I’ll have drank two things of hard liquor and downed a bottle of tylenol, benadryl, steal some stronger pills possibly, etc. Various Elliott Smith and Kimya Dawson songs will be playing loudly through my headphones. I’ll feel the warm, inviting sunshine on my exposed summer skin. Bright and docile, it gives my skin a bit of color. The sharp blades of grass will gracefully touch against my legs and thighs. My cheeks will be red and my mind foggy. Woozy, I’ll lay down on a nice checkered blanket which I’d bought a few days earlier, and feel my body turn to mush. With closed eyes, I’ll liquify, feel the warmth on my skin, and slowly feel the life seemingly leave every orifice in my body. It’ll seep, seep, seep out until there is nothing left to give. I’ll leave a letter besides me for whoever, or whatever finds me first. If they can read it- hey, that’s just a bonus. Whatever finds me, or gets to me first, will be in control of whatever happens to my deadweight carcass. Eat me, leave me to rot, toss me in the ground, watch the flys hover and worms wriggle throughout my flesh, burn me- I don’t care. I only wish for the sweet, deep release of death.   I don’t know if this instance will happen anytime soon, but it’s inevitable. I feel dumb for posting this, but I more of just needed a place to vent and wanted a few people out there will know what happened. I’ll delete this in like an hour or two."	sw

"I can’t cope. Might as well just do it Every day is a constant battle. I stay in bed for 2 hours each morning, thinking why I should get out of bed. The only reason I do is so that I don’t piss/shit myself. I then have breakfast, stay in my room, lunch, stay in room, dinner, stay in room and go bed. That’s the life I’ve been living for over a year now. I’ve had therapy, I’m on antidepressants and nothing seems to be working. I’m currently waiting for more therapy but I don’t know how to cope with this wait anymore. One day I feel like I’m gonna burst and do something stupid.  I thought about ways I could harm and kill myself; I have scissors in my room so I could cut myself, I could try and OD on my antidepressants, I could buy a rope and hang myself, I could stab myself or cut my throat, I could go to my nearest shopping centre and jump off the highest level. The amount of the detail I’ve gone into for each possibility is terrifying. I’m so scared that if I tell anyone this, I’m gonna have leave home.   I know it’s stupid and a cop out. I don’t know what to do with myself anymore and how to cope with day to day. Everything I use to love, I hate now. Too many anxieties limit myself on what I can do.

Back to where I was nearly a year ago About a year ago this May I posted on another account about how I wanted to die because I messed up my relationship among other things. I then sorted things out with her and everything was great which I updated on.  Now we are taking kind of a break because yet again I cannot be a good person. I always just do shit my own way without thinking of her feelings and opinions.  We have been talking all day and she says she loves me still but she is not sure if she can believe that I can be that person again. I had already promised her this but I just took her for granted.  We had an abortion a few months ago which I was always for but I did say it was her choice. We had it but she told me how much she regretted it after and I do too as I know we would be a happy family by now and would be getting married in one month.  Now all of that is gone or in doubt and I have nothing to show for my life.  I just want to end it but I am also scared to end it. I live near a large bridge that connects Wales and England so it is always an option for me but I don't know what is left for me in life if we end.  I am a bit of a loner and so is she but I don't blame her for wanting to end it. I have fucked it up so many times	sw

"Saying I want to die is becoming less painful when I say it   About 4 years ago I realized I hadn’t known what I wanted to do with my life, and ever since then the anxiety of falling in a rut in college and not knowing what I wanted to major in would lead me to drop out and I wouldn’t amount to anything. This only becomes worse with the fact that I’m failing several of my classes right now and I’m so stressed about one of my classes that it’s consumed almost every second of my life and has caused me to feel depressed. Every time I try to study I just can’t grasp the concept and it leaves me with even more stress.    Failing a class doesn’t usually hit me as hard as this has, because I can usually bring the grade up to at least a B+ but I’ve hit the point that it feels like nothing matters. I don’t know what I want to do with my life and I’m certain I won’t ever amount to anything that would make me successful, much less happy. I have constant anxiety and I stay up until 5am trying to study but I can’t do it.    Even trying to study feels like such a chore, my GPA is already dropping, my class rank is just getting higher, and I’ve realized I’m not smart enough to simply get by on good grades alone, so I’ve had to resort to trying to figure out what I want to major in and get by on hard work, but I can’t even figure that out.   I’ve been feeling depressed for about a month or so now and I can’t tell if I’m subconsciously faking it to get attention or if I’m truly depressed. I just don’t know what to do anymore. For years I’ve had suicidal thoughts, but when they first started I would break out crying because the thought of doing such a thing was too much, but now it just feels painfully easy to say and I can’t even tell If I would actually do it or not. It’s just an empty feeling at this point and I’m sure if I didn’t have family or friends who I’m scared to disappoint, I would have already attempted it. It feels like I’m just not trying hard enough and I’m weak but I can still work myself to exhaustion and fail at everything I do. I just really don’t know how to handle myself anymore.  "	sw

"Who am I to judge if someone has ""depression"" Is it bad I don't believe her at all? She says people who attempt suicide are ""fucking stupid ass retards"".

"I feel utterly alone I have nobody. I was living in a different state, had a good job with friends that I loved seeing everyday, for the first time in a long, long time things were looking up. I was managing my mental illness and I always had someone to talk to or hang out with. Then my house caught fire in January and I had to move across the country back in with my mom. Lost most of my clothes and possessions and now I have no friends and nobody to talk to.  At first everyone was sympathetic and hit me up to say they were sorry about what happened but then a little time went by and everyone forgot about me. I understand, life happens and people move on. I just hate being left in the dust to stagnate. I don’t have a doctor here so I slowly ran out of my medications. First I ran out of my anxiety meds, I can barely leave my bedroom without wanting to die. Then I ran out of the meds that stop me from hearing voices, sometimes I hear them whispering to me in a language I don’t know, other times they just just keep saying “do it” over and over. For a long time I wondered what it was they wanted me to do but I think I’m finally realizing what I need to do. Then I ran out of the anti depressants and everything seems so hopeless. I can’t afford to go see a doctor and I’m not even sure I want to. Why should I live the rest of my life pumped full of pharmaceuticals that make me feel terrible? It would be easier for everyone if I just died. I don’t have the energy to fight just to continue to exist and not really live. I’m only 21 but I feel like I’ve been suffering through two lifetimes. I don’t even know why I’m posting here, I’ll probably be gone within a couple of days anyway. I think I really just want to be heard before I end it, I left my life and my friends behind and it’s like I stopped existing when everybody forgot about me.

"Since A.P. Bio targets the IFC/Adult Swim demographic, NBC should fuck with everyone by airing the unannounced fake spin-off ""Heather"" alongside its time slot. Just like the title says, if NBC is trying to act all cool with the trope-defying ""Bad Teacher"" gender flip, they should back that street-cred up with something really unexpected and WTF-worthy.  A half-hour devoted to the happenings in and around the life of Heather and her creeped out family would fit the bill.

"Help 23 y.o female. I have been battling with suicidal thoughts most of my life, but it has been intensifying over the past few months and I know that if I continue on this path I am going to finally give in. I have struggled with self harm and especially cutting but it is at the point now where it doesn’t even do the trick anymore because I just feel so... numb. The logical side of my brain knows that I have a good life- a dedicated husband, great job, loving family, decent home and two sweet pups. I have so much to live for... why would I ever think about killing myself.. right? Yet here we are...   I have never had any big trauma happen in my life to make me feel this way. Just gradually over my life since my teens I have become more and more numb, emotionless, and hopeless. I feel like I have no one to talk to even though I have so many people in my life who would listen if I opened up. I just feel like they don’t understand and would judge me.  I’m from a very rural/conservative area in Virginia where you definitely don’t talk about these kinds of things and anyone who does just gets a “bless her heart, I’ll pray for her” kind of response (if that makes sense), yet everyone is shocked and heartbroken when a suicide rocks the community.   My husband and high school sweetheart helped me through my depression in high school and I temporarily stopped cutting which was amazing because at the time I was severely into cutting. But now, it’s like he’s numb to hearing me say I want to kill myself and doesn’t really know what to say so he just doesn’t say much other than reassuring me that he loves me. And I think because I have been talking about it for so long he’s subconsciously thinking “yeah yeah okay I’ve heard this 100 times she’s not really going to do anything, I have nothing to worry about”. Definitely don’t blame him for anything because it would get exhausting listening to the same depressing shit over and over again. I guess that’s why I’m posting because I need to talk to people who I can relate to on these things.   Anyways. I have made several appointments to get myself checked out by a psychiatrist but always cancel my appointments because I’m too scared and don’t know what to expect. Plus I am very anxious about talking to a stranger and honestly just want to go in, get prescribed some drugs and maybe get a formal diagnosis- I don’t want to do talk therapy because I honestly don’t think it would benefit me.   I guess I’m looking for some advice on what I could expect if I were to go seek professional help, things that have helped you, and ways to get out of this rut of constantly thinking about ending my life."	sw
"I don’t identify as a Millenial Let me first start by saying at 18 years old I had the tendencies of a Millenial. I worked a part time job, lived with my parents and only had food and my video game addiction as my only bills.   Fast forward to now, I am married, have a career, and own a house.   What changed?  I believe it was when i met my now wife at 19. I came to the conclusion that we were meant for each other and we both had responsibilities to make sure we had a decent life together.  I quit my part time job and got a new one working full time 40 hours/week.  It wasn’t easy at all, but I think that is what separates me from my generation.  Nothing you want in life is ever going to come easy.  We rented out a room for $700/month and we both saved up as much ad we could. We didn’t go out to eat, we didn’t buy fancy new smart phones, and my gaming addiction abruptly ended.  I spent a little bit of my savings to go to school, and get my 2 years associate degree, which i used to get my career at 24 years old. She saved up to buy a car. (We only had one car at the time and she was taking the bus).  25 years old, we got married and 7 months later we had just enough to put a down payment on our first house.  Our commute is not ideal, it takes me an average of 45 minutes to get to work, her about 30 minutes. A small price to pay to be a home owner.  26 years old and I am in better shape than anyone I know because i buckled down and made sacrifices to be where I am.   "	cc
"So much pain I really wish it was legal for me to get medical assistance with dying.  Life just seems to be getting worse, and I have increasingly less energy to continue surviving.  I'm a trans woman in my 30s.  Since my earliest memories, I knew there was something wrong, but thought it was ridiculous that I wanted to not be a boy.  Every day I would get reminded that I was a boy, that I would grow up to be a man, and that anything else was inconceivable.  I was told that I had to learn to perform masculinity, and being the people pleaser I am, I did my best with that.  When puberty hit, my world crumbled.  My voice started deepening, I grew facial/body hair, and I started looking more and more like the man I never wanted to be.  I also realized I was attracted to men.  Probably because transitioning still seemed like science fiction to me at the time, I came out as gay.  I endured a lot of bullying and hate when I came out in high school, but hey, that was the early 2000s.    At age 30, I finally came to terms with the fact that I wasn't a gay man.  I hated being male, even a gender non-conforming one, and started realizing that transition was actually a possibility for many people.  I came out a second time as a trans woman, found acceptance in my family, started hormones, changed all my papers, started gradually being gendered as female, met a straight guy who happened to find me attractive, and even underwent bottom (genital) surgery.    By all accounts it would seem I'm a trans success story, but that is wrong.  I have been spiralling down into this bottomless pit of depression and anxiety.  Although pre-transition, my maleness brought me so much pain, now that I've completed transition, I feel so much more dysphoria knowing that I've done most of what I can and still see a man in the mirror.  Whenever I'm out in public, I have a constant fear of being 'clocked' (found out as trans), and it's gotten so bad that I never leave the house.  I experienced a lot of violence and harassment early in my transition, and every time anyone so much as looks at me for longer than 20 seconds, I start panicking thinking my life is probably going to be in danger again.  Yes, I pass in the sense that no one (including completely strangers) has referred to me as a man in a year and a half, but I know that the majority of people can probably 'tell' after taking a closer look at me.  At 5'3 I'm also a really easy target for harassment, so people are completely uninhibited in laughing or snickering at me.  At best, I've transitioned to a very odd-looking, masculine, androgynous woman.    I wish I could undo everything, but (a) I've built this life around my female identity, including a relationship with a man (and his family) I'm not even sure I deserve, and (b) I keep remembering how awful my dysphoria was pre-transition too.  No matter what I do to my body, or what I call myself, there I am: a person with crippling dysphoria who is unable to escape from their pain.  I so wish I could end everything right this second.  I can't help but feel this life was not meant for me to be in.  "	sw

"Woke up today, to see a dream come true. Woke up today, to the news of my exam results. I am finally going to become a doctor. It's just 1 year of internship left.  There was nothing surprising with the exam results for me. I knew that I am going to pass my exams. What was surprising was that I managed to secure distinction in two subjects: Obstetrics and gynaecology, and pediatrics.  What makes me more happy is that my health was not at all good for last few months. I was unhealthy even during my exams but I kept my shit together. My disease would sometimes make me feel frustrated but I never let it affect me for a long time.  I kept telling myself that it is the pain which will make my success more enjoyable. And it is, indeed, more enjoyable."	cc

"Settling other planets Ok so let's assume we're the only intelligent beings in the universe (even though that's statistically improbable). If we settle on other planets the people living there will evolve to suite the needs of that planet. Maybe theyll have senser bones such as people living on Mars so they can walk naturally on the surface and some will have incredibly thick skins and strong muscles to withstand the pressures of Venus. My point is that even if we are the only ones now, through evolution the human race will evolve into a hundred different species within the next billion years. So in theory we will have created a new form of aliens.   Of course the faster version of this would be terraforming, and even then the planets may not be perfect meaning that the people of one planet will be different the the people's of the other. It's at this point we have to ask if we are all human or are we different species all together? Will there be new forms of discrimination? I feel shows like *The Expanse* do a great job at showing these differences. "	cc
"I can't believe it. After more than 20 long, grueling years, this is finally going to be the end. I have decided once and for all to end it thanks to today's event which acted as the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back. Long story short, a girl I've been speaking for many months now, whom I like and who likes me, a lot, has spent that last four months trying as hard as she can to avoid seeing me and talking to me so that she can get over her feelings for me. Whenever I ask her why she can't just let me take her out, she'd always have a reason why a relationship is not the right step for her and that based on her past relationships, we would focus to much on each other and begin doing bad in school. Because of this, despite the fact that I live one street away, she refuses to see me. It's been 4 months. We haven't had a decent conversation in 1 and a half.   After all this time, she met another man at the bar, one of her drinking buddies, whom she is falling for and is over me.... which is what she wanted from the beginning. She didn't want those feelings for me to be there. I don't know why. Why am I poisonous? She has no problem seeing this other guy almost every day and violating almost every reason she had for not wanting to see me. I am a fool. I am a fucking fool. On top of that, the emotional abuse and trauma as a child, the family ostracization from childhood to adolescence, my grades spiraling out of control at that time, my brother passing away, my friendships being facades that were manipulated only to use me, my relationships that were only to toy around with me.  I've decided a long time ago that I wasn't meant for happiness in this world, but I think now, I realize that maybe its not just that I wasn't meant for happiness in this world, maybe I myself wasn't meant for this world.  I don't want to die, I just want to not exist anymore. I wish I can one day just be walking down the street and have a car just come and hit me. I can't think of anything more beautiful.  Anyway, I am still working out the details, but I do know that I want to go on my own terms. The day before my birthday in July so I do have a little bit of time to get things ready. Thank you for listening. I hope you guys don't get to the point I'm at....it really feels terrible. I don't wish this on anyone."	sw
"I don't know what to say Back in the middle of February, I had a massive blowout with my mom, because I tried to call her out on being a horrible parent and being half of the reason why I attempted suicide before. She ended up turning everything around on me, using my few slip-ups against me and invalidating everything I tried to say. Ever since then, I've been completely unable to articulate my emotions in any sort of confrontational way, because I've been too nervous that what I would say was just my melodramatic brain skewing events to my favor. I've essentially gaslighted myself into being incapable of standing up for myself. My world is still crashing down around me, but now I can't fight back and try to fix anything because I'm so scared of getting myself in deeper shit."	sw

I am in my final semester of college and just the other day I handed in the final check paying the last of my college tuition. No longer can I cross the street without a care and mentally chant ""Pay my tuition"" to any of the cars that drive by me. It's kinda surreal.  One of the factors that went into choosing my college was the fact that it had fairly cheap tuition. The price to be a full time (in state) student adds up to just a little over $6000 a year. This is actually cheaper than the tuition for the private high school I went to. I didn't dorm because the school is pretty close to home--it's only 11 miles away but due to the fact that it's in Manhattan and I live in an outer borough it takes about 1.5hrs to get there via public transportation. I also never really needed to get actual textbooks for a majority of my classes. All of this added up to me not having to pay crazy money for school. On top of it, I got a couple of scholarships. I'm so glad I have no student loans or debt to pay off after graduation.  I just never understood how people could drive themselves into debt for going to a private college or dorming when they didn't need to. While there are times I wonder what life would be like if I had gone away for college, I don't regret my decision. I have an upperhand than most college graduates financially and I'm really happy about that.  One weird thing though, I have a hold on my account right now from financial aid even though I never receive that. My coach actually emailed me about it earlier today and said I should go to bursars to fix it so I can graduate. Hopefully it's just an error in the system (which seems to happen often) but I'll find out tomorrow.  Do you have any loans/debt you're currently trying to pay off?

You can see that people are separated into groups - regular sailors, the leaders, the doctor etc. They differ by their uniforms and what they do. But then you realize that underneath all the clothes they are all the same. They are all just random packs of meat. But for some reason it has happened that this pack of meat is regarded as something more valuable than these other packs of meat so obviously it means that this pack of meat has to wear this specific hat with this specific color and size and that the other pack of meat have to do what this pack of meat says. It's just so ridiculous. If you stripped them all naked and threw them in a hole you wouldn't be able to tell which is which. "	cc
"Somehow I’m a comedian now Throughout my childhood and teen years, none of my jokes ever landed (except with family- but they were kinda obligated to laugh I guess). *I* was fairly proud of most of my attempts at humor, but the most I could ever count on eliciting from other people was a pained groan or eye roll. “Heh funny” was rare but welcome, and “haha funny” was never even an option.  As I grew older and less awkward, I started noticing that people enjoyed my humor a little more, but it still never really took off.   Fast forward to now: my colleagues and I are in our 30s with kids and beer guts, and suddenly everything I say is sidesplittingly funny. I’ve heard some form of   >Dude where do you even come up with this shit? You’re fucking hilarious!”  twenty or thirty times in the last couple of months, and I’ve finally realized my dream of being a casual comedian.  MFW I realize I’ve been telling dad jokes for 25 years and just had to wait to find the right audience.  It almost makes all those wedgies worth it."	cc

Music=photo what? Ok so I commented on a thread yesterday about something I thought would be a little more common and maybe it's I have no idea.  I'm an amature musician and have a passion for pc gaming too. So it's fairly common to listen to music and play games at the same time that's basically a given tbh. However that's not my question. My question is does anyone else ever feel like there getting something I've nick names music triggered nostalgia. Ok hear me out I know it's a bit wierd and cheesy. I used to read a lot when I was younger and alot of the time I was reading I was listening to music usually one while album through to the end. Usually I'd listen to the album more than once while reading the same book. I also used to just listen to music doing basically everything too.  So sometimes Spotify will throw out one of the songs of those albums and it's like someone flicks a light switch on or opens a door into the plot of that book or the scene or activity I was doing at the time.   It's very vivid and I can sometimes even picture the lines of the book and what I depicted the scene as.  So in short I'm asking is there anyone that knows anymore about this or experiences this.  Thanks for reading it I know I'm not very good at writing clearly.	cc

"I am at the lowest point of my life right now. Crying my eyes out I am writing this in tears. I am probably in the lowest point of my life right now. I don't know where to go from here.   I am nearly 25 years old. For my entire life I've been alone. I never had any friends, nothing. I was the loneliest person you could imagine. I would go through weeks without saying a word, forgetting how my voice sounds. All of high school - nothing. Never saw any human being outside of school hours. Didn't go to college, started working as a software developer right after high school.   I learned to live with it. I got by, day by day. Learned to live with myself. I would spend most of my waking hours in commuting to work, reading, and working out. That's it. I was depressed, but learned to live with the devil inside me. Perhaps every couple of weeks I'd go through an episode of depression, but all in all things were decent.   I had accepted my faith and learned to live with the cards I was dealt.    8 months ago a miracle happened. A colleague of mine, which I had a crush on (but then again in those days I would get a crush on anything with a heartbeat) began flirting with me and asked me out. I went through a panic attack when she did so, but managed to say yes and go on a date (which by the way, is one of my proudest moments - I had overcome so much to go on a date with her. I can't even begin to describe what I went through before that date. )   We ended up together. For over half a year. I was over the moon. Somebody cares about me. Somebody found me attractive. I had someone to talk to. I was having physical contact with another person for the first time in my life. I had sex. I had a friend. My first real friend. The first ever non family member human being to come into my room. I shared my life with her. Told her everything. My deepest secrets and fears.   It seemed like she was so into me, that till this day I remember several conversations with her, which I asked how is this even possible, and if I'm dreaming the whole thing. She even proposed to me and said she wants to be the mother of my children. We had even started looking for apartments together. I swear to God this is true. I really do. I know nobody will believe, but she did. She got down on her knees and proposed.   But then everything went down hill. I learned people are evil and cruel. I was a rebound from her previous relationship. She was never really over her ex. She cheated on me with him, and lied to me for months. Telling me she's with her friends or family, while she was at his place.    And I found out. Turns out you can gain some kind of social instincts, even if you're a complete loner.   But hey, she said she's sorry and I decided to forgive. What kind of idiot gives up on the first ever person to show them love?  So I tried to forgive her. We lasted for another month. And then she dumped me. Over text.   Never saw her again. Tried contacting her yesterday after two months, in hope for reconciliation. But she's over it. She forgot all her promises of being the mother of my children. Of marrying me and living with me.    And here I am. Crying my eyes out.  It finally hit me - I'm back where I was before this relationship. I'm all alone, I'm depressed, I'm crying.  I work 11-12 hours a day. Money piles up in the bank and I have nothing in my life to spend it on. I will never find someone new, I am back to being alone.   Only now, I've also seen the other side. I know what I'm missing. I know what holding hands in bed with another human being is like.   What's the point. I spend hours in front of a computer screen every day at work. Hours commuting. Sleep, work, eat, cry and talk to myself.   I have no reason to wake up in the morning. Is the potential grief of my parents a reason to keep living?   This is the lowest point I've ever been in my life. I have no clue where my life goes now.   I really don't think I'll ever come out of this. "	sw

"My estranged father is trying to come back into my life. He wrote me a letter. What should I say? I won't get too deep into details but my father is a deeply troubled man. He isn't a bad person but his good intentions have caused a lot of pain and heartbreak between me, my mother, and my sister. I guess I could call him a toxic person. Very emotionally abusive, but not physically.   When I was 13 my parents split (more like, my mom came to her senses, grabbed my sister and me, and ran away). A restraining order was placed. Again, he never hit us, but it was more of a precaution considering his mental instability.  A few months ago I turned 18, meaning the restraining order no longer applied to me. I knew he would try to find me but I also knew that whenever that inevitably happened, I wouldn't know how to handle it.   The other day I opened my campus mailbox to find two letters from him. One of them was a simple Happy Easter card. The other one had a large quantity of bills, and a check for a LOT of money made out to my university (paying off tuition has been a struggle).   I was pretty freaked out, and compulsively deposited the check  (I know I should've waited). But now that he knows I've opened it, I feel the need to say something back to him. He literally knows where I live so I can't ignore him forever. What sort of thing should I say? He put his number in the card but I don't think I'm ready to just call or text him whenever yet. I feel like writing him a letter back?? I'm usually good at handling myself but when it comes to anything involving my old man I can't really function. So sorry if I sound a little ramble-y.

"Currently sitting in a hotel near Beachy Head, one of the world's most famous suicide spots. I'm hoping to jump tomorrow. I spent the day walking around the cliffs. I've never been here before but settled on this place because it has such a high success rate. I promised myself that if I were to go through with this I had to make sure I succeeded the first time and didn't just end up with some brain or internal organ injury. My only regret is that some poor team will have to clean up my remains, but I'd rather a team of experienced people do that than being discovered by someone I know.  I've wanted to commit suicide for a while now, but even still, before I arrived here I was worried that I'd see it and be too scared to do it outside of my own home, but it is very peaceful here. It's almost a surreal place, it's perfect. I was also worried about encountering the volunteers who try to stop people from jumping, but I didn't see any on my walk today, though that may have been due to the weather.   I've posted on here before under a couple of usernames and have had some nice messages of support, so I thought it was fitting to write a little goodbye to the few people who cared towards the end, you guys do great work for many people. If any of you happen to live in Eastbourne and hear about a young man jumping in the next few days, just know that I'm finally at peace, I'm sound of mind and it's what I wanted. "	sw
"Save me Romeo         It’s getting worse, it keeps getting worse, why? Why? Why? My parents found out I’m still trans ( pre-transition), and they found out I’m still gay. I’m 14 and I’m living in jordan, I hate my life. I had a big fight with my therapist at conversion therapy and my mother is going to switch me to a new therapist. Everyone tells me I’m going to regret transitioning but I get angry at the thought of staying a male. My (former) therapist last offered me to tell my parents to let me transition, last afternoon I told him I accept his offer and he didn’t comply and we ended up fighting and I keep arguing with my parents. I hate my life, if only My unrequited love was bi ( and not straight) and reciprocated my feelings, we would be together and I would have left conversion therapy long ago and no one would know and I would have the patience to wait till I’m 18 to transition (more info on my heartbreak in my last post). Today has been one of the worst days of my life, for the past 6 weeks I have been at my lowest: heartbroken, unaccepted, lonely , friendless , numb and dangerously depressed. I want to kill myself but I fucked up in my last 11 suicide attempts since August 2017. I also cut myself today, now my wrists are  filled with plasters. I’m not crazy, am I?

To make a long story short, I was reviewing a student’s rough draft essay, and their topic/argument was that schools should serve less healthy food, and serve more snack foods. They recommended schools serve “things like Oreos and pop tarts, instead of broccoli and carrots” because students think “healthy food taste wrong and doesn’t fill them like junk food does”. That’s not what really bothered me about the essay, though it was a part of it. Their main argument as to why they are right was “because some students don’t get to eat at home, and school is their only meal. So they should be able to eat what they want”. I know this student was talking at least in part from experience, but since I can’t give personal opinions about his essay (just because I don’t agree) I just had to fix errors. It really got to me however, because what I wanted so badly to say was, that’s all the more reason for them to eat healthy, and that the reason junk food makes you feel full is the same reasons it’s bad for you, but I couldn’t. I know this is more of a reflection of us as a society, (with junk food being more accessible to families suffering poverty) but it was still a frustrating thing to read through none the less. I figured reddit would have some insightful things to say on either side of the argument, so I brought it to you guys for discussion."	cc

"Had some good job interviews Yesterday I had my second interview with a company and for a role that I'm really interested in. It was a harder interview, but I think I hit all the key points and represented myself well. So if they choose not to move forward then at least I'll know it's because they want someone with more experience than me, and that's fine.  I'll hopefully hear back from the recruiter on next steps by the end of the week.  But it feels nice when you can do an interview well and feel okay with the results. It's a privileged position that I know a lot of people don't have the luxury of appreciating, but it does feel quite nice. Just wanted to share feeling hopeful about the future today."	cc

"*not urgent* I don't know anymore First off I put not urgent so people who are in a much worse place might be tended to first.   I've  been having mood swings the past few days and now I'm just plain depressed. I don't want to die, I just don't want to be here right now. I lost most of my friends recently, it was great I became happy for once not needing to deal with people who didn't care about me but at the same time I'm back to square one; alone. (that's not to say I want them back, I don't. Its just... yeah)  The thing that's been keeping me going over the years is video games. I love playing them, analysing them, and noting the mechanics, level design and script work. But now I have no one to play with, no one to talk to about it. Just sort of seems pointless to log in. It sounds pathetic but games are in a way my life. I'm going to Uni studying games design.   I'm just stuck, I don't know if I can make friends, and I'm not sure anyone would be willing to get to know me. I don't know anymore."	sw
"The only thing keeping me alive is family The only thing keeping me alive is the thought of what my family would go through if I were to kill myself. With each passing day, it seems more and more likely that soon this won't be enough to stop me from acting. At a certain point, the constant sense of dread has to be more painful than the knowledge of what my death will do to them.  I can't enjoy anything in life. No matter what I do, depression looms in the background making sure I know that happiness is unattainable. I laugh at jokes; I watch tv shows; I play video games; I talk with friends; but it's all a show. I'm not actually happy.   I'm convinced depression is the psychological equivalent of cancer. It slowly destroys you from the inside. Some people respond to treatment, others don't. I am one of those who's unlucky enough to not be treatable. I've tried meds, therapy, groups, etc. None of it works. ""It gets better"". Does it? I'm tired of the generic one-size-fits-all bullshit advice. I don't think it's going to get better for me. I think I'm staying alive - I use 'alive' purely in the biological sense, I can hardly call what I do 'living' - just for the sake of others. At some point I need to do what is right for myself.  So, I don't know when or how, but I do know that my life will end soon. And honestly, I think that's okay. It will hurt people around me, but they will move on eventually. And I won't hurt anymore.  Thank you for reading."	sw

"I finally learnt how to ride a bike at 20! I'm nearly 21, and have always wanted to learn. My brothers know how, but I never managed to learn since I grew up without a bike. My younger brother tried teaching me but he got frustrated and so did I, so it never worked out. But I and a friend in the exact same situation set out today, rented a couple of bicycles, and in an hour we were moving on our own! Faceplanted, cut my hands, bruised my legs and scraped my lip over the course of two hours and it was fantastic!  I know a couple other Redditors have posted here about learning to ride later in life, but I still felt so silly for not picking it up quickly. Going at my own pace was really helpful, so if you, like me, are still waiting, that's ok. Doing things in your own time makes it that much easier.   What are things you still want to learn?"	cc

"I just had a dream where I 1) basically had a girlfriend and 2) she broke up with me, and now it feels like that happened in real life My first break up (about a year and a half ago) left me pretty distraught, so I know that anxious feeling in your heart (like you get when you see an ex in public) pretty well.  The dream itself was kinda weird. It was about a girl I'm really good friends with (that I just so happen to have a crush on and is amazing) but who has a boyfriend right now. I guess the premise of the dream was that she broke up or just didn't have a boyfriend at the time. So I was all like ""great, time to make some moves"". But no, somewhere in the dream she told me (I really don't remember specifics, it's really fuzzy now) that she was leaving the area or something and that either we could no longer be friends (she didn't put it that way, just that either the distance or her personal choicr meant we couldn't keep in touch or that she needed to get away for a while) or she got a new boyfriend.   Either way, it felt like we broke up, and now I'm feeling like we actually did irl. I've been awake lying in bed for over an hour pondering the dream, but I should have gotten up 15 minutes ago to get ready for the day. Now I'm low-key depressed about it. It'll be weird seeing her in person today lol, and it's probs unhealthy that I'm feeling this way.   Also on a random note, I had a dream two days ago where I did have a girlfriend and we meshed sooooo well in the dream; it was AMAZING. It's not like we banged in the dream or did anything in particular (at least I don't think we did), we just went about normal life."	cc

"I've finally ditched my iPhone for a Samsung. First of all, I don't want to start an argument here. Each has its own pros and cons, it all comes down to the person whose using it.   I'm normally an Android guy, but switched to an iPhone 6S Plus, 28 months ago, because at the time there weren't any good Android phones in the market (at the time. The phones were either known for overheating (thanks to Snapdragon 808/810), sucky battery life (once again, thanks to the 808/810, and Samsung for putting small batteries on their phones), and has defects (bootlooping, easily bends, etc).   I just wanted a phone without any defects, has good camera, has LTE bands I need for Asia and North America, and something that would last me all day. The iPhone 6S Plus fitted the bill. It served my needs for the last 28 months.  However, I wanted a dual-sim phone, so I would no longer carry two phones, due to greedy carriers here. Besides that, mainly I also miss Android's versatility. You rarely need a computer (to transfer stuff). Also, I switched to an iPhone because they have Apple stores and authorized service center throughout the whole world, so I can have my phone repaired in the same day. But then I realized that we don't have any Apple stores in the country (the Philippines), and there's one service center nearby, and they won't service a phone that wasn't bought locally. Whereas with Samsung, they have a brick and mortar stores, and service centers here.   I decided to trade my iPhone 6S Plus for a Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro. A used 6S Plus and a like-new Galaxy J7 pro worth about the same. The camera on the J7 is just as good, also has the LTE bands my iPhone offers, and it has a bigger battery. With those, I don't really miss my 6S Plus. I wanted an S9 Plus, but I can't afford it.  It feels like the weight has been lifted off my shoulder. I no longer need to carry two phones, and I now have versatility of Android, back. Besides, I now have a bigger battery. Which means, even with heavy usage, I won't have to charge the darn thing for two days. I still have an iPad, so I won't miss iOS either  Anyone switched from one platform to another recently? "	cc

"Always worried about accidentally offending people I am always worried about accidentally offending people. I am wondering if others sometimes feel the same.  For example, a high school teacher of mine tends to give me life advice. I like how she is doing this.  So she was once giving me some healthy eating advice when she met me (we were talking about something else earlier on). When we were chatting, I said ""lol this is awkward"" and ""lol not even my relatives and previous teachers tell me this"".  She seems taken aback and asked me what I think of her advice. I said it's nice thanks and then we go back to having a conversation. She continues to give me advice on other stuff.  Tl;dr: I am struggling in high school and a high school teacher of mine likes to give me life advice. Once when we were chatting, I said ""lol this is awkward"" and ""lol not even my friends and previous teachers tell me this"". She seems taken aback, asked what I think of her advice, and I said it's nice thanks so we went back to talking like usual. Did I offend her? I am scared that she will stop reaching out to me and I don't want that. "	cc

"So I started an attempt to learn Japanese... ...and I'm wondering if I'll ever be able to conquer more than just memorizing what all the hiragana characters are. I knew Japanese was going to be more complicated than learning Spanish, which came quite easily to me in school (although I've forgotten most of it by now), but the fact that I would have to memorize essentially 4 different sets of characters (hiragana, katakana, kanji, and romaji) is overwhelming! I'm mostly doing it for fun, although I would love to visit Japan one day, and I figure having a basic understanding of the language would be helpful. But it seems like it's going to be a bit more work than anticipated, and I just don't know if I can/want to devote that much time to it.

I don’t want to do this anymore I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety   Since my freshman year of high school. I made a plan to kill myself after I graduated high school but I backed out. I didn’t go to college right after graduation so I took a gap year. For that whole year I was depressed but I managed to workout everyday and I lost 40 pounds but I ended up developing an eating disorder I starved myself and only ate about 500 calories a day and sometimes less. According to my doctor I’m a healthy weight for my height but I feel so disgusting still. During my gap year I decided to go to community college because I felt like such a piece of shit for not doing anything even though I’m a horrible student and  it was part of the cause for my depression in high school . I’m 19 now and I’m finishing up my first semester in Community College and I fucking hate it. I’m only going because I feel like I have to. My heart isn’t in it at all  I’m on spring break right now and I go back on Monday. I’ve been drinking and crying for the past three days about it. I want to drop out but I don’t want to feel like a fucking failure. But I can’t do another year and a half of school. I knew my mental health would somehow get in the way of going back to school.   I’ve been having suicidal thoughts like crazy my depression hasn’t been this bad in a while. Everything seems pointless. I feel disgusting in my body I want to starve myself thin. I want to get blackout drunk and down all the pills I can find. life is fucking hard we all die anyway so why not take control of how and when you’re going to.	sw

"Don't know if I can do this anymore This is the first time I've posted on here, but I really need a place to vent. I feel I am at a breaking point and I don't know what to do. Be prepared this is a long one.  I am having a hard time finding a reason to live life anymore. From a young age I have always felt that people have taken advantage of my naive nature. When I was 5 til about 8 I was raped by one of my mom's friends. I did not know at the time what had happened to me, but it made me not socialize with other kids at school. I remember the police being there and my parents being upset. I remember thinking this is not something to share with my peers. I kept to myself and found comfort in colorful things, cartoons, Pokemon etc. Anything with a happy or positive vibe to make me feel like I had friends or that there was good in the world.  Fast forward til I was about 13, I started to feel really sad all the time and had no idea why. My parents told me it was my hormones changing, and that I was fine. But it felt really bad to me. Like I shouldn't be alive. I started doing very poorly in school, was picked on, and tried to take my own life. My teacher and parents didn't pay any attention to me and I had no friends still. My parents and teachers eventually met together and decided that it would be best to hold me back a grade to readjust me. I was devastated. I felt like such a loser. The following school year I decided no more, I wanted to make friends and stop being alone. I was instantly popular. I had so many friends, girls chasing after me, was always around people. Then my parents moved me and I had no internet, no phone, no way to contact these people. I had to start all over again and didn't want to.   Next we are at age 16. I make friends with all of the goth kids in school and realize that we have alot in common. It's nice to find solace in others who have thought or attempted to harm themselves, or had a darker view on life. Alot of them were bisexual, which made me nervous because of the rape incident. But I had started noticing boys and liked them,   I came out as bi, later gay. I felt so disgusted with myself because I didn't know if this was how I was supposed to be or if I was like this because of the rape. To this day I have some trouble knowing.  High school goes well, make lots of friends with the goth kids, until age 17. A girl I had been friends with wanted me to be her boyfriend.  She was obsessed with me but I told her that I was gay and not interested and would still love to be her friend. She then proceeds to drug me. It left me in a coma for 3 months. I wake up from the coma scared and confused. I develop an anxiety disorder. I become afraid of people, afraid to socialize even more. Start having lots of panic attacks.  I nearly fail school yet again because of this. I was never offered any consuling, never any help. Then again I didn't really want it. I am afraid of taking too many drugs and becoming a zombie. I dunno I'm afraid of drugs after being drugged. Get forced to go to therapy after telling my parents that I was gonna shoot myself. Go to therapist, get prescribed Zoloft 25mgs. Works pretty well helps take away the panic attacks at least.   Meet an older guy, he's 10 years older than me but looks around my age. Move in with him right out of high school. He makes me feel good about myself, calms me down during my panic attacks, seems over all good for me. Ends up leaving me because we had been dating 5 years and he couldn't marry a guy and couldn't deal with my anxiety. I'm devastated. Jumped so quickly into things that I didn't go to  college, no money saved, etc. Was homeless for a few days. My friends take me in and I live on their couch.   Start dating another guy, he leaves me because he can't handle my anxiety problems. Start to really see a pattern and realize people don't wanna deal with people with mental illness.   Start seeing my husband at the time. Our relationship starts out really good. He quickly moved in with me. Fast forward 2 years and he asks me to marry him. Finally I feel safe and secure. I feel like no one else can harm me. I feel like I don't have to worry about drugs or rape or being alone. I was wrong. He becomes extremely abusive. Gives me black eyes, chokes me, had a seizure, put a gun to my head and said he was gonna kill me, wouldn't let me see my friends or family. Controlled every aspect of my life. I felt alone and hopeless but at least I had a place to live until he decided to kill me. He ends up asking for a divorce. I'm devastated yet again.  There's a guy who came into my life almost a year ago. Says he's straight, but always initiated things. Fall madly in love with him. First person in my life who has ever had faith or believed in me. Go to visit him for a month. We have a sexual relationship. Leave. Tells me that it was a mistake. Too embarrassed to even let people know I exist.   ***Long story short*** Right now with being rejected by someone I had grown to love and going through a divorce and being forced to socialize after being isolated by my ex husband and having to be out on my own for basically the first time, getting a job and having to know that I need this to survive, wondering if I'll be stuck doing the same thing over and over again. Losing that job and being homeless. Been having lots of thoughts about hurting myself again. I am tired of all the things life has given me. I feel alone and am sick of it. I feel like I'm forced to start all over yet again and don't know if I want to. I have this view on the world that it's suppose to be a good experience but it's never happened. I'm 26 years old with nothing to show. No-one to care about me. I don't feel that I have any reason or any right to be alive. I just wish I wasn't such a coward and would just do it. I'm sorry for the long rant I just needed a place to express myself without judgement. Whenever I try and talk to someone they usually end up not understanding or leaving or i end up attacking them because I feel vulnerable.  I dunno what to do anymore.   "	sw
"Adults with issues, how do u deal with it? Because I can not take on the world and my internal struggles at the same time. My internal struggles just wreak havoc to everything else in my life.   I know people here deal with all sorts of things and with age you get good at hiding. But you have to deal with it alone and you have to keep moving on. I know people say there are others that help you, your parents, your friends, you guys. What I have understood is others - they may be supportive and try to help you in many ways, but eventually it boils down to you and you alone..May be this is what 'adulting' is like. And I don't think I know how to 'adult' with everything thats inside. Does it go away, does it fade, do things normalize... How do I adult with everything that's within?"	sw

"I felt so embarrassed. So I was at the drive through at a fast food restaurant. I was ordering (and the guy serving me already sounded upset) and all of a sudden I hear a horn blaring. I thought it was the person in back of me, and I was on the verge of getting out of the car. Then the person in my passenger side was like, ""Um, you may want to get off of the horn"". I realized I was leaning on the horn and was so embarrassed. I can't imagine what the person in back of me was thinking. Also on top of that, the guy serving me sounded so upset (even more than before) and he was just like, ""Just come up to the next window"". I then when up and he didn't seem too pleased...

"My classmate is amazing! Hi! Just going to share something.   I have a classmate (let's call him K) who is really good at a subject, while the majority of us are struggling. The subject content is pretty heavy and most of us are attempting to cram for our mid-years and dying of stress. It's a subject that is not commonly covered in high schools and we have an external lecturer to teach us. Plus, we may be one hardworking class, but we aren't exactly the smartest as a whole.  So K, being the smart kid, proceeds to make and distribute worksheets for us to do once every two days. Actual worksheets! As far as we know, he's piecing all of the questions together with past year papers and class practices. He releases the answers a day later and goes through the difficult questions during recess.   We all are really grateful to him and the effort he puts in. He even puts cool inside jokes and other funny stuff into the questions. No one else aside from the members of our class knows about this yet and he's doing all of this pro bono, so I just want his actions to be appreciated. he'd kill me if he finds out about this post though, so I'm hoping that he doesn't use Reddit :P  Does anyone know other smart kids who go out of their way to help their weaker friends?

"Phobias and mental health worries too strong. My hypochondria triggered a manic episode a few days ago, and I can't see a doctor for the problem I'm anxious over until April 16th. I've lost 6 lbs from not eating, I can't sleep for longer than 3-4 hours, and I'm getting all the other fun side of agitated mania with soaring levels of anxiety and fear + delusions and hallucinations.   I'm so terrified. My body is tense all the time. I broke up with my boyfriend yesterday out of manic frustration and energy with the notion that I was going to die soon. The worst part is I don't even know if my death will be a suicide or from my own body. I'm just scared, scared, scaaaared all the time. Massive panic attacks are becoming the norm for me and I don't know if I'm going to be able to make it April 16th just to quell what might be a minor issue. The mania isn't helping.  My therapist highly recommended I go to the ER/psych hospital if my symptoms become strong again, and I can feel that tonight is going to be a very hard night, but I don't think I have it in me to ask the person around me for help when it's midnight and they're aware I lose my shit over small things due to severe anxiety.

"I hate debating with other people on complex topics. Screw debating, on the internet and in real life. Topics have so many sides to them and there are so many conflicting statistics that say different things that after a while of thinking I never know what stance I want to take on it. Yet so many people find it so easy to do so, and have such an irritating sense of self-righteousness about their opinions at that.  Not only that, but a lot of people (me included if it's something I have a strong opinion on) will get bloody defensive and angry if their obviously correct opinion is challenged. And both sides will say such incendiary, rage-inducing stuff to each other and yet expect the other side to simply accept what they are saying, without acknowledging that both sides have their points. It's almost impossible to think objectively and logically when this is happening.   Eventually the debate becomes more than a simple disagreement and becomes personal, where both sides just want to win in order to demonstrate superiority over the other person. Most of the time whoever ""wins"" is only the person who's the best at arguing and deflecting their opponent's arguments. It has less to do with who's actually right and more to do with the skill of the person making the argument.  So, fuck debating. It's terrible."	cc

Not just the usual genres such as classical or jazz (although I do enjoy both of them), but also movies, gaming soundtracks, contemporary classicals, etc..   On Spotify, I often find myself in the ""Focus"" category just because most playlists there are instrumentals. Don't get me wrong, I do sometimes listen to songs with vocals too, but with instrumentals I'm not ""forced"" to listen to the lyrics, but just take in/get lost in the melodies or the sound of various instruments.

"Fuck this bullshit Every day, I used to be hyped to go home from school to escape the pain. The standards are too high for me and everyone thinks I'm so smart when I'm actually just some dumbass kid who tries to hide his failing grades. My friends are all jerks, and they think I don't know that they don't like me. I spend most of my freetime at school trying to find people I remotely know so I don't have to look so fucking alone. I used to go home and just be able to sit and think about if everyone's life is like this, just sit in my room and cry. And I guess that was tolerable for a while. Now I don't even have that. My parents don't understand why I'm always so down and they always ask ""hey, are you okay?"" And I say yes and it just ends there, and they think they're taking care of me. They think I'm doing great, and I'm popular and smart. But I just live my life trying to fit in and achieve, failing, then coming home to my clueless and tormenting younger siblings. It's sad that I have to talk to online strangers about this, but my parents would just say it's bullshit and I'm overreacting and I'm perfectly fine. I'm fucking not. I'm a wuss so I can't end my life. I'm only 13 and everyone would probably think that I'm to young and immature to understand this shit, and I'm just complaining. I'm fucking not. I believe in God, and I'm praying for him to show me a sign that I'm just complaining, or that my life has a purpose, or that things get better, or even that he cares about me. I'm starting to question my faiths, but at the same time not because if he is still looking down on me I'll be punished. My life fucking sucks but I'm too worried about death, and at this point I don't think I can make a turnaround. I just want to fucking leave. 13 years old and I'm already at a break in point. Am I too weak? Is this a phase? Did life meant to be like this? There are so many people who go through this daily that it's hard to think this shit isn't twisted. It is twisted.

Keep on thinking of things to post, but then remember I deactivated my account. Like any addictive habit, its almost painful to suddenly cut it out.

While cutting out social media isnt easy, id say its easier then most addictions.

"Has anyone else made a sort of deal with the universe and as a result of doing so something very unlikely happened like it is the universe upholding their part of the deal? This has happened to me twice, both the times I have made such a deal, it has happened. The first I was playing an online game, and there was a chance of getting a very rare item that I knew had a chance of probability of 1/2500. Before taking the chance I said if it is this rare item I will take it as a sign to go an peruse my dream career. Well I got the item, I was so shocked. I thought about this for a couple of weeks afterwards but to be honest I didn't honour my side of the bargain.  Well today I was playing online poker in one of those really big tournaments that can have thousands of players. Around 1700 started, and with 180 people left I was around 145th. For reasons I don't really know I thought to myself ""If I win this thing I will take it as a sign that there is some kind of balance in the universe and I have get my shit together, I know it won't happen, but go on prove me wrong"" I already plan to get my shit together, but now not doing so makes me potentially sort of accountable to something bigger than myself. The odds of both of these things happening is so slim. I am not saying I am ready to jump head first into mainstream religion and whatever is bigger than us needs to be praised and have endless personal sacrifice for, but maybe I should take this as a hint that life might be bigger just the literal aspects of it. Plus I won all of my football bets today. I am sure others will just think it is pure coincidence, and they might be right. Either way I went and bought a lottery ticket, because why not?

I once began to feel so horrible for being those things (except male). God I felt awful. I truly felt like a waste of human life and that I didn't belong.

I would end my life in a heartbeat if it weren’t for the the thought of how sad my family would be if I were gone. I can’t picture my grandparents or my brother or even my dogs in a world where I kill myself and that’s the only thing stopping me from killing myself. My friends tell me they’ll “never recover” if i kill myself, but I know they’ll be fine. When I miss school no one knows it, when I don’t show up to things no one worries about me. I could kill myself and no one at my school would know for a week. I started chocking in class on Thursday and it took my table mates over a minute to notice. The worst part was when I was choking I was low key hoping that that was it and I would die. The big idea is that I’m a loser no one gives a shit.  Sorry for the incoherent ramble and for wasting time in your day. I’m fifteen I’ll be fine."	sw
"Does anyone live somewhere that you just CAN'T escape construction noise? I have literally 3 different construction projects going on on 3 different sides of my apartment. From 7AM-7PM every single day all I can hear when I'm home is power tools, people shouting in Portuguese and beeping vehicles. Time to get a great pair of noise cancelling headphones and wear them every second I'm at home I guess? "	cc
"To kill you or to kill myself? I'm tired of this world.

My family members are to do with most of it. And, I am literally on the brink of getting a knife and killing as many people as I can get away with until I either get killed myself or arrested. I feel as if no one truly cares and I'm stuck. I know I need help but I swear this now... I will go berserk on the next person who starts being a passive bullying cunt to me. It's either gonna be me or them DEAD."	sw

"I want to create t-shirts to change the world for better. What topics, phrases, ideas are missing on our tees? I have a feeling that t-shirts are more than the piece of marketing for brands and propaganda for politicians, it could serve a much better cause. For example, shirts played a huge role in branding the **March for Our Lives** and uniting people across the US around this cause.  But there are so many more themes out there that require our attention, the topic that is being left aside by the t-shirt designers.  I feel so about **ageism** as a very unpopular topic, even **sexism** — most of the shirts do not educate, they abuse the theme, IMHO.  Which topics and, perhaps, thoughts you think should be put onto t-shirts so people who see them on me and you would become better human beings: towards other people, animals, planet, the world?  Please share your thoughts."	cc
"a company just cancelled my interview tomorrow morning and i'm feeling more than bummed So I had an interview with a company at 9:30AM tomorrow and HR just contacted me 30 minutes ago saying that the position was filled. In all of my professional development classes, the profs have stressed how disrespectful and unprofessional it is to cancel interviews less than 24 hours before; they also stressed professionalism in general. I get that companies don't have the time to be so sensitive about feelings, but I'm pretty annoyed at how they confirmed my interview time this morning and within 8 hours, cancelled it. At this point, I'm so salty I won't ever apply to this company again, but that's just me. Also, why does it seem like professionalism and just basic respect is a one way street? Have any of you gone through the same ordeal? Or been on the opposite side and actually were the one to cancel?"	cc
"I understand suicide I'm starting to understand people who commit suicide. It's like, when you know you have the rest of your life to look forward to but you look at your life and just can't imagine living it every day, year after year. You have people tell you it gets better but it's been years and it hasn't so it probably won't and you're tired...so tired. You just don't want to fight through the day anymore. I think when you commit suicide it's with the knowledge that there will be people hurting once you're gone but the idea that your pain will end may make it seem worth it. Suicide is indeed selfish but, perhaps for some, they have to be selfish because for years they put everyone else first. Always gave and gave and gave and no one bothered to see how they were...how they were managing...if they were ok. Maybe they were sucked dry by life and just couldn't take it anymore. For some, life is fleeting and they live it to its fullest...they enjoy it and love it...but for others...its so long...never-ending...painful. Being alive and living are two different things. Maybe some people who commit suicide actually died a long time ago but the people in their lives were so busy taking, they couldn't give a minute to realize. Death is funny like that; it's not always on a physical level.   I have struggled with my depression the majority of my life. While those I care about thought I've gotten better, the reality is, I've just gotten better at hiding it. There are nights that I lie awake dreading waking up, living the day that just ended again, over and over. It's a cycle that never ends...nothing ever changes. Nothing good is sustained. Life just continues tomorrow exactly the same as it was today. Every bad decision plagues me and losses I've suffered haunt my thoughts. On the rare occasion I attempt to reach out, I know I will mostly be met with half hearted attempts to listen or understand. There is usually only a distracted silence on the other end of the line.   Night before last, while lying awake, I realized I understood people who committed suicide. That scared me. I am in a dark place and I have never felt more alone in my life. This is a time where I could have used the most support. At this time I no longer feel capable of maintaining relationships. It's taking so much effort and I need to put everything I have left into my children. They have to be my primary focus and I'm just not sure I have enough in me to be a good mom and daughter/sister etc."	sw

After years of depression and self harm (about a year clean) and feeling terrified that I’d never end up doing anything with my life...I feel like I’m getting a fresh start (kinda). I probably won’t graduate until I’m 26 and will be older than most of the people in my classes but who cares. I’m gonna turn 26 anyway, so might as well get a degree in the meantime. Now to brush up on my math so I don’t fail my first class and lose my financial aid all over again.

"My opinions on the Pinocchio Paradox. Hallo. There was this idea I thought of a long time ago that I wanted people's opinion on. It was nothing too big, I just wanted a nice little discussion. However, I put that on rest since I didn't know where exactly I should talk about that. Recently, I came into notice of r/CasualConversation which I found to be a neat little place to talk about random stuff. I thought it would be great to be finally able to share and discuss about this idea. So without further ado, here it is.  If Pinocchio says, ""My nose will now grow."" he would be lying and this will cause the nose of his to grow. However, since his nose grew, he would not be lying and his nose should not grow.   I believe that the answer to this solution is, his nose will grow if Pinnochio says the special statement. This is because the nose only grows if Pinnochio himself is the one who is lying and note that the statement is said before the nose started to grow. His nose only corresponds if he is lying or not; it does not count the actions of itself either. If we count in these two factors, I believe we will have a solid reasoning that the answer to this paradox, will be that his nose will grow.  So er well, what do you think?"	cc
"I drinked with friends yesterday and now I've got a bad moral hangover I don't see them often, they just text me when they want to have a kind of a party. Actually I won't call it a party at all, we are just old friends who parted ways on some point of our lives and we like to talk over how everything's going now. We drink but more for the company than to feel fucked up. After all I've heard yesterday I just feel like something's wrong here. They all have partners or really good friends who they were texting most of the night  and I can't point out a one person who I can text no matter what. I don't like commitment when it goes to something less than love, I could even say that I can't commit to someone I don't have true feelings to. It really sucks to think about it sometimes but I can't force myself to something I don't want deep down. Even if I try, it turns out that I'm only poorly patching a hole named ""love"" and I betray these people unintentionally when I find someone. A ideal scenario for me is having a long term relationship and some casual acquaintances. And these friends who have really good social circles now are people who totally changed their surroundings, mostly because they are studying in other towns now. It made me think, didn't I made a mistake staying here? Should I believe in this ""everything happens for a reason"" thing? My head is literally exploding from being unsure of almost everything and I think I'll be heading to Starbucks because I really need coffee and I really need to binge watch the new season of A Series Of Unfortunate Events. Do you ever question your life because of someone or something? "	cc
"It's a hell of a lot easier to laugh than it is to cry. I was sitting in my grandfather's dining room a few weeks ago and above his table, he has a big painting. It's a really beautiful painting and my grandfather usually has pretty great stories so I asked him about it. He said that it was kind of a funny story;   When he was in college his grandmother lived nearby so he would sometime go visit her, one of her favorite things to do was to go to an auction house nearby. One weekend he and his grandmother went to the auction house together to watch the auction, they had a general rule just to watch and not to buy anything. They were walking around, just looking around at the things for sale when my grandfather saw this painting. He asked the auctioneer how much a painting like that might go for, the auctioneer said that it really depended on who was buying that day. So my grandfather and his mother moved on to look at the other items.   A little later as the auction was going on the painting came up for sale, people were bidding on the painting like crazy so my grandfather jokingly raised his paddle, Sure enough, he won the auction, the painting was his for $500. Except, he didn't have $500, so his grandmother (who was quite wealthy) decided to buy it for him. He also didn't have the space for this painting, so he sent it home to his mom's house.   When my grandfather got home for summer break his siblings got wind of the $500 painting his grandmother got for him, they were not pleased. So his grandmother decided to write all his siblings a check for $500 and his mom decided that she would like to keep the painting. In the end, my grandfather, a broke college student, ended up with a painting that stayed in his mom's house until she died and his siblings ended up with a $500 check.   It's kinda a funny story now, but I can imagine it was not so funny at the moment. My grandfather finished the story by saying ""It is what it is, and it's a whole hell of a lot easier to laugh than it is to cry.""  This is some of the best advice I've ever received and it made me wonder, what kind of stories did your grandparents tell you? What's the best piece of advice you've ever received? Do you have any fun stories you'd like to share?"	cc

"My friend committed suicide 1 day after I hung out with him on Christmas on the 26th. Could've I prevented his suicide? I did not call him or skype him that day. I seriously regret it. But we were supposed to hang out on Thursday. Idk how to deal with this tragedy. I had no idea he would do this. So a really good friend of mine that I knew for 10 years committed suicide on the 26th of December of 2017. This has made me feel very insecure and almost depressed. He lived 40+ minutes away from me. But the thing is he told me that we will go to Arizona to check out a school there. And we were supposed to hang out on Thursday the 28th. But I have no idea what caused him to take his life. I got the call from his aunt at 11pm on that Tuesday as I was going to bed that he is in the hospital. And my mom came in my room later and told me that his mom told her that he hung himself. I did not talk to or see him that day. But earlier that day he uploaded a Snapchat video of him watching Lord of The Rings on a Macbook Pro. And the regret I already have is why did I not talk to him on that day? That's what is bothering me about my friends death the most. Is that I wish I asked him if he wants to hang out with me on that day. But I had no idea that he was gonna do this because there were no warning signs or I did not get any feelings that he was gonna do this. But he smoked weed alot and I heard later that he took XANAX(anti-anxiety pill) and mixed it with weed and painkillers. But I am not sure if that was the cause of his death. I asked my Parents and Friends about why do I have such a regret of not reaching out to my friend that day because I wish I reached out to him and ask ""Hey wanna hang out?"" or something? But they keep telling me to not have such regrets and there was no way that I was going to prevent my friends suicide. Why do I keep feeling guilty? I miss my friend. And I wish he was still here physically. But I heard he had depression and he never told me that he actually had depression. I miss my friend and I want him to be physically here again. What do I do? On the Monday(1 day earlier) that I saw him he was completely normal I did not notice anything strange in him his suicide just completely caught me by surprise. The 25th of December of 2017 is the last time I saw my friend. The thing I am trying to figure out is why he would do such a thing and not think about his friends? Cause I miss my friend so much. I wish I talked to him on the day he killed himself but then again I had no idea that he had depression or was planning suicide. But still I can only imagine if he would've been alive if I asked him on text if he wants to hang out. My friends suicide has been tormenting me and I keep asking myself why did he take his own life? I really wish I called him up but my other friend tried to call him but he did not respond to his phone call on the day he killed himself. I have been struggling to focus in class. I keep thinking about him day and night 24/7. The thing I miss the most is hanging out with him and skating. I wish I attempted to call him up that day and it's haunting me. I've been struggling to have a piece of mind because of this. Please help. Any useful advice? "	sw

"I live in the northeast, and I'm pretty much convinced that January through March are the shittiest months of the year, but the remaining 9 months are good! What do you think?   I kinda broke it down like this. April is when the weather starts getting consistently nice, spring is nice for being outside, Summer's great because it's warm and that allows for being outdoors a lot, swimming, hitting the beach, etc. Fall is nice because of football season and the fact that days are still pretty nice at first, and by then it feels nice to switch it up a little bit. November and December are okay solely because a little cold after 7 or so months of fairly warm isn't a terrible thing, and you have holidays like Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years, Etc.   January through march though, there just really isn't much to offer on the table!"	cc

"The silver lining I've been suicidal since my teen years. I recently turned 27. I still don't feel better about life, the universe or anything. However, I've used my suicidal thoughts and depression as a way to not feel anxious about taking risks or trying new things. This is a realisation I came to last year and it has helped me a lot.  My reasoning is that if the results of my actions are bad enough, then I could always just kill myself. It's a safety net, basically.  Maybe this can help others as well. Just know that you don't have to give up and die, you can let suicidal thoughts work for you and at least stand a chance of feeling a little bit better during the darker days, by knowing that you always have a way out. So please get out there and live a little. It has kept me alive for over a decade."	sw

"Meeting up with old friends (#93) ^^^^I'd ^^^^like ^^^^to ^^^^state ^^^^that ^^^^I ^^^^started ^^^^writing ^^^^this ^^^^before ^^^^midnight ^^^^so ^^^^ha  Today me and five friends from high school met up for the first time together in over a year. When I was in high school I became really close with a group of girls who were a year ahead of me and they're really the only people from my high school I keep in touch with (despite going to such a small school where everyone knew each other). We're always so busy though so it's hard to get everyone together. We were meeting for dinner at an hip Italian food place which I originally wasn't excited for because I've had Italian food too often than I'm not interested in it.  Anyway, so I worked out at school before I met up with any of them and I was going to meet up with one person around noonish. When I called her it turned out we were on complete opposite sides of Manhattan. So instead of being smart and picking a spot to meet up at we decided to walk along an avenue until we found each other. This entailed a lot of back and forth and phone calls asking ""where are you"" until I finally told her don't move and I'll come to you. We then went to get food and had awesome bacon burgers and then we walked through Central Park.  In the park we went up and down so many paths and eventually got near the area where I always practiced for cross country so I showed her around there. We started at the south east corner and when we were finally leaving the park we were at the north west corner (and it was fun with how we left because I didn't feel like looking for a path that actually would leave out the park and so we climbed down a hill to one of the exits instead).  Then we took the subway down to around China Town and walked uptown to get ice cream at a place that makes ice cream rolls. Then we walked to The Strand book store (probably the biggest independent bookstore in Manhattan) and we walked around there for a while. I bought a couple of books, a pair of corgi socks, and an improv game.  Finally it was around the time we were supposed to meet everyone so we waited at a park and collected our group then went over to the Italian food place. It was hard to find seating for all six of us but we managed to get a table and then when we got our food (it was a counter-service style place, not a normal Italian restaurant) the chef was super chill and making jokes with us as she prepared our food. The food was so much better than I was expecting. We all talked and talked for a while since it's been so long since most of us had seen each other. We started playing the improv game (it's called Human Beings if you're curious) and we had a bunch of fun with that. Then we got desert at a gelato place (I got hot chocolate since I love that and I already had ice cream earlier in the day). While we were just chilling on a bench outside the gelato place I did one of my trademark activities with my friends which is: read passages of a book that are totally normal in a really seductive voice. That is always fun and turns into a wild ride. We then realized it was 10pm and passed some of our bedtimes (we're old ladies despite all being 21-23) and so we headed for the subway. Only one of my friends lives near me so she took the train all the way with me and then my dad dropped her off at home instead of having her wait for the bus she had just missed.  It was so fun catching up with all of my friends. Even though we have diverse interests (and I personally cannot mention my political opinions around them since they differ so much) we all love and support each other and are all amazed by what everyone is doing. We were all the nerds in high school and still have maintained ourselves well as the years have gone on. We can have such long and deep conversations about basically anything and it's awesome. We're all entering actual adulthood now with everyone graduating/going into grad school/getting full time jobs and it's so crazy how when we all became friends our biggest worries were tests and papers. They're a really good friend group and I hope to never lose them.  What was the most you ever walked in a day?  Do you have any weird talents? (like me and the reading of the books)  Ever go to a place to eat with really low expectations and end up surprised with how good the food was? or vice versa?  Can you get along with people who have differing views on things than you do?  ---  ^^This ^^is ^^post ^^#93 ^^out ^^of ^^~~365~~ ^^360something ^^with ^^my ^^goal ^^to ^^have ^^a ^^conversation ^^on ^^here ^^every ^^day ^^of ^^2018. ^^Feel ^^free ^^to ^^comment ^^on ^^anything ^^I've ^^said, ^^answer ^^my ^^questions, ^^or ^^just ^^talk ^^freely ^^about ^^yourself ^^even ^^if ^^it ^^doesn't ^^relate ^^to ^^the ^^post. ^^I'm ^^here ^^to ^^chit ^^chat.  ^^It's ^^been ^^[20] ^^days ^^since ^^I ^^last ^^missed ^^a ^^post"	cc
"The army doesn’t believe I’m suicidal... About 4 or 5 weeks ago, I finally broke down and found the courage to go to behavior health after everything started falling apart around me.  They had me take a test that basically said I don’t have a disorder like bipolar, ptsd and so on... cool, I could have told them that. But because I don’t have a disorder I must be “fine” and I’m just saying the buzzwords.  They don’t seem to give a fuck about the fact I bought a knife just for the sole purpose for the day I finally decide I’m done... which is most likely today"	sw
"How to Help a Friend Who Wants to End It All? Gonna try to keep this short so,  A friend is expressing suicidal thoughts, there isn't any one problem (just everything, and some other heavy stuff).  I live a couple hours away so I can't be there, and due to different schools we don't talk much, but how could I help?  A quote from this person ""I feel like I'm constantly just trying to escape the world"" (on top of other things).  How can I help?"	sw
"Two weeks. I could do it in two weeks. Quick and use a gun, or slow and use a knife and take a relaxing bath.  I probably won't, and that's good. But I feel like I could and that's the scary part- being okay with it.  I hurt and I don't know how to make it stop hurting, hopefully I'll be better by then, but right now it's me and these last two weeks.  "	sw
"Has anyone seen Mother! what did you guys think of it? I'm a big fan of horror or psych thrillers and I was pretty excited about this movie, but almost every review I've read said it was disappointing or called it ""torture porn"".

"I'm not worth the resources it takes to sustain me? So I want to kill myself to sacrifice myself for the planet. I get so heartbroken thinking about all the disgusting toxic waste my very existence necessitates. I mean sure, I can reduce reuse recycle, limit my use of plastic, and whatever-the-fuck, but I can't shake the feeling that my meager existence could never, ever even begin to justify the destruction my body's rampant consumption does to the planet. I'm what, here to marry so I can help make more destructive abominations, just to make my mom happy? It's not a good enough reason for me to keep fucking shit up at the rate that I am. I can't bear the thought of the elephants. Why is it shameful to want to go back to the void? Why do I have to suffer and languish here for godknows how many more years for the sake of other people? Why can't it be noble to opt to leave? I think I should be free to make this choice with honesty to everyone in my life, but I know that will never, ever happen. I'll never be able to talk about it with anyone in real life without them completely freaking out, so here I am here. What do you guys think? Life is amazing, and weird, and beautiful, and profound, and I love you all truly and deeply. But I just want out now. Can't that be okay?"	sw
I got a job as a security guard. I am 24 and I just got my first job. I will be a unarmed security guard. My first duty will probably be to watch a election trailer in the evenings.

"Anyone excited about their Vacation? Since its summer here in my place and my friends,neighbors and schoolmates are posting their summer adventures and i felt like striking a little talk about everyone's vacay.  -Just talk about what your plans for your upcoming vacation will be and if your excited about it or whatever.   I know i am excited about my two month summer vacation. Because i'll be doing some new-ish things for my sorry life for once.  I'll be getting a new laptop that ill use to""self-teach"" my ass about programming stuff preferably Java and maybe some of that sweet sweet GameMaker Studio.  I'll be trying to make Need For Speed Payback Cinematics (look up CROWNED for examples) because im into racing games and of course the cars. And im hoping the cinematic tools work on a pirated copy.  This april i'll be taking my drivers test or driving school or whatever its called which is nice yeah. i think thats the one im both most excited and anxious of. But hey yolo.  And i'll be turning 18 by the end of the summer. Thats honestly a lot of things that im ""Planning"" to do this summer and for a person who is ""usually"" socially inactive, self-loaths a lot and spends free time alone this is a step up for me. (And maybe play some Pokemon GO while im at it)      "	cc
"Whenever I try to get help with anything, I just get people telling me they don't believe me. And then they start suggesting I do things I'm already doing. And people get angry when I tell them I'm already trying to do those things, and they just repeat themselves. They act like everyone's life is the same as theirs, and then they get everyone to stand behind them. And I get downvoted to hell.  How fucking hard does life have to be to get to the point where NOBODY believes it's possible???  I'm starting to feel like anybody who was able to have a decent life from nothing actually had a good life all along and was just chosing to throw it away and be negative about it.

"Anyone ever take a new route on a run/walk and find something cool they’ve never noticed before? Yeah so not terribly interesting but I live like 10 minutes away from a farm and I never even knew it. I discovered it last summer on a run when I ran through a different route.

"I don't know what to fucking do!!!! ok. Let me start by saying my hand writing is bad and that is because I am fucking incapable of doing anything right ok. my brain is completely on fire! It feels like I have all these issues fucked together and know way of know how to express them. I can't seem to fully understand what is wrong with me, I feel like a 5 year old in the body of a 15 year old, I have basically 0 friends, my family does not understand me to the point where I am breakdowns because I am so tired of being misunderstood but like I said I don't know how to explain myself. I have been diagnosed with adhd but I am pretty sure I have OCD and BPD and probably more because I'm so fucked up. I'm also in high school and I just wan't to be normal. have friends, be smart, have hobbies and interests, confidence in myself, socialist etc.. but I can't and I feel like positivity is just being unrealistic, I can't take this anymore each and every day is hell. I doubt anyone here will be able to really help me and I understand that sadly I'm basically unfixable. killing myself is becoming more and more on my mind. anyway thanks 4 reading this I know its horribly written but idc anymore lol.

"i dont know what to do. im horrible at this type of thing.   ive been in a strange situation in life these past few months. ive been suicidal/depressed since 2009, and over the past 2-3 years ive gotten so much better, but ever since august ive completely fallen apart, and suicide is the only option i see as a solution."	sw
"Can't get help I've suffered on and off from depression my whole life. Suicide runs in my family like diabetes runs in other people's family's.   I fought against medication for a very long time. But finally broke down in such a way I was sure I wouldn't survive without it.   And it helped. So much!  I didn't feel ""okay"" but I was much better.   Then my husband lost his job and with it our health insurance.   And with that, my medication. Because my doctor has refused to extend my antidepressant prescription unless I get therapy. Which I can't afford with my husband out of work and no insurance.   I contacted the sliding scale therapy/ health coverage people and the wait list is 1 to 3 months long (depending on need, based on their evaluation of my self evaluation compared to others').  I've been off my medication almost a week. I feel the depression getting worse again. And I'm so afraid of getting back to where I was.   My husband wrestled a loaded gun from my hands 3 months ago. I was trying to shoot myself inn the head.   No one will help me. And I don't know what to do.   I don't want to sink that far again. I was going weeks without showing or leaving my bed for anything other than going to the bathroom.   What do you do when no one will help you help yourself???"	sw
"If you were to go to college on non-STEM degree, what major would you choose and why? Basically the title. I'm trying to gain some outside opinions on the matter, because my family is very science-ey and does not have any wisdom to share and a major part of them would lose their figurative s*it if they knew I am not going to get a STEM degree. So, what I'm asking is, which humanities major offers the best prospects for future? Thanks in advance!"	cc
"What happens when you go to a hospital? Throwaway account for obvious reasons.  Recently I started being open about this kind of stuff. The doctor told me that if I got in a bad spot and couldn't get out, I should head to a hospital and they'll help me out.  What exactly does that entail? What sort of things do they do? I've had quite a few bad times but I've never really thought of going there.  Edit: I'm in Canada."	sw
"Talk me out of killing myself tonight Long story coming.  So ever since I was young, I felt like I didn't belong anywhere. At that age I brushed it off as being smarter than other kids (I attended a special class for advanced kids), but as we all know, that is never the case. As I got older, I looked on social interactions as a skill, so I tried to learn that by mimicking others. It did help in getting to point, I was able to make beer buddies and have one night stands with girls. I looked good at that time, which helped.  That was around age 16. I noticed, however, that none of that relationships became true friendship or long lasting relationships. Some girl liked me because of my looks, some guy hang out with me because I'm fun at parties, and my schoolmates liked me mostly because I could help them at their studies. I would always have someone to go out drinking or partying with. However, whenever I felt sad, or I just wanted to talk about my geeky interests, I never felt there's someone I can talk to. And I was sad most of the time. Now as time passed, this developed into a full blown depression.   As my condition progressively got worse, I found myself many times sitting next to train tracks, wondering about what it's like to jump. I like to think of myself as self-aware, so naturally when it got to that point, I tried to combat it. I even went to a great therapist and was fine for a long time. However, then came graduation.   I met a girl that night. We talked a lot, and one thing led to another, in a month we were officially a couple. That was my longest relationship at that point. She just got rid of an abusive boyfriend, and we both loved the idea of helping each other's suicidalness with mutual love, it was really like a fucked-up romantic movie.  Well, nearly 3 years have passed since then, I'm 21 now. I really did help her, she went from suicidal to pretty stable. I got accepted into one of the best universities in our country, pretty far away from our town. My life became a living hell after this. Since the first time in my life, I felt loved by anyone. So naturally, I tried to be with her all the time. This resulted in constant traveling between cities. In itself, this would not be a big problem, however to pay for the uni expenses, I have to work too. And I study computer science, which is a pretty hard subject. But, in itself this would be managable.   Besides all of this, I became sick, physically. I don't know what it is, because the doctors couldn't figure it out yet. All I know is, it's something to do with my bowels. Oh, and it causes terrible pain and hair falling. Normally, the pain is bearable too, but whenever I workout (which I used to do regulary), it was too much. This caused me to don't go to the gym anymore, so I got fat too. That one is all my fault, I could have eaten better, but my negative self image contributes a lot to this story.  So, my daily routines consisted of either studying and working all day, or travelling all day, and two day a week spending for hours with my girlfriend. Sounds pretty shitty right? Day by day, during this 3 years, my mental condition got worse and worse. Sometimes so bad that I went days without sleeping because I was to sad to think about anything but dieing.   At least I still got the love of my life, right? Well, I had, until today. But she told me pretty clearly that she just doesn't fell it anymore, so we should break up. And I accept that, you can't force feelings. But fuck man. We went to so much shit, I lived a living hell just so I can support a future together. The only thing I ever looked forward to in my life was making money so I can buy a house and spend all my free time rising English Bulldog puppies together. (Bulldogs were my happy animals before her, and they helped her too. [Look](https://www.sunnyskyz.com/uploads/2013/06/f4f5c-cute-bulldog.jpg) at this little guy at tell me he doesn't make you fell better.) But, now even looking at a bulldog makes me sad. I know it sounds idiotic, but it does, and it makes me feel a lot more shittier that it does.   No she threw me out, and here I am, looking like shit, withouth a girlfriend, without a single friend, my only vision of the future shattered, feeling sick as hell. And I just don't know. I don't know how could I take anymore of this shit. If only I had one crossed out of this list. If I were healthy that would be enough. If I had friends it would be enough. If I had her, it would be enough. But I have none, and it just makes me sick. I wish that I could go back, back to elementary, attend a normal class and make friends. I would be happy with just one. Fuck, back before I met her I used to go to suicide chat rooms to help others. It made me feel better that I was help. But right now I couldn't do that, because if they asked why not to kill themselves, and I couldn't say that it will get better. It only ever gotten worse for me in the long term.   So yes, I don't really wanna die. I made a second reddit profile to post this, because I hope someone can give me a reason. I'm not willing to endure this pain anymore. Noone should feel this way, and I can't even imagine what others feel who have it worse. I just can't stop thinking about dieing. I sit here, watching videos of cute bulldogs, while listening to Suicidal Thoughts from Biggie. I sat my facebook up, so I can post some music and a goodbye note in the last second. I bet everyone will be fucking surprised. I never spoken to anyone about wanting to die, besides her and the therapist.  I actually had a classmate kill himself when I was younger. I didn't understood it at that time, the reason why he never tried to get help. I understand now. Life is shit. Kinda hate myself for never getting close to him, maybe we would have became friends. Or maybe not, as it never seemed to work for me.   Anyway, if you read this far, thanks and sorry for wasting your time. It's 21:50 (9:50 pm) here, as I'm writing this. I have to get up to uni at 04:00 am, so I will be checking the net, and reddit until then. I won't lie, I would really love a reason to live. But I don't believe I will ever get one. If you read this after 04:00 am, I want you to know that I want at least my death to be fucking awesome, so I wrote in my will to get cremated and smoked by everyone who attended the funeral, like 2pac in that urban legend. If I make the news, please post it here, that would be kinda cool.   Thanks for reading, and goodbye.   "	sw
"My week was horrible Monday to Friday had to be some of the worst days of my life.

"Does it actually get better? I've tried so hard to be better. I went to college, I managed to pass a semester, but its not what I want to do. I suck at what I want to do. I've always been terrible at science, but I wanted to be a vet, I wanted to help people and animals, but I just cant pass science class. I'm just too stupid to do what I really think I was meant to do. I don't want to work another poitnless job, that only helps a company make more money, but I am just too stupid to do what I want. I should die. I need to die. I'm a useless thing and I need to die. Why can't I just die?"	sw

I’d just like to be fucked hard not by any of you fine laddies and gents of reddit, but by my life. It’s got a boner and it’s going up my ass.

"It's probably a good time to die Why are people still reproducing instead of fighting for our rights and our future? The world will be soon inhospitable for the human race.

Profit before the People. You're SOL if you were born into a low-income family with a disability.  Why even carry on? Why even live when there's not many years left on this planet and you're already suffering.  Fuck this shit.  EDIT: just to clarify, I'm not telling anyone to kill themselves. It's just how I see things and I don't want to live through this anymore."	sw

"Well, I just got pulled over for the first time today. Let me set the scene:  I just got off work. I'm tired, but happy, because it was my last work day before I go on a trip out of the country to see my best bud. I'm singing along to my tunes and I accidentally completely just blow a stop light. No cars were coming or anything - completely clear non-busy road, so I didn't even think about it. The second it happened, I'm like ""oh, fuck..."", then pulled over for the cops before they even put their lights on.  I also have absolutely nothing on my record, the only ticket I've ever gotten was a parking ticket for like $16 once because I forgot to fill my meter at work.  Anyway, I'm scared shitless. Cops come over, both girls, and I'm a young guy just scared out of my mind. I roll my window down ""oh my gosh, I'm so sorry, I just got off work and wasn't even thinking."" ""Yeah, you completely blew that stop light, do you have your license, registration and proof of insurance?"" ""Yes, of course."" hand her my stuff, and then asked her if I could unbuckle to get my registration out of my passenger glove box lol.  They take it, ask for a good phone number, then back to their car where I assume they scan it? Hand it back and said that it's okay, it happens, and to just be more careful and be safe on my way home. So, no ticket! Yay! I assume being pulled over and no ticket means it does not go on my record...  Anyway, super thankful and I guess good karma exists."	cc
"Narcissist Losing I havent been diagnosed officially as a Narcissist, but a psychologist friend of mine pointed out that I exhibit traits of vulnerable narcissist of cluster B personality. I have done few research and I believe she was right.   I have been lying about my success to everyone around me. But truth is I was terrible, I was unemployed for 2 years, I used to lie to people that I am at work. I got back to school to finish my undergrad. My course is getting over soon, I am going fail real hard. People are going to know I am a failure and shit person. Its killing me every day, I have anxiety attacks thinking about it.  I stopped using any social media, stop meeting people. But I know I cant run for long. Only way I can end this is by ending my life."	sw
"To the people who like to talk to introverts - What makes you like to?

"The fact that my life isn't that bad makes me more depressed So I just tried to get on the suicide prevention online chat thing and while I was waiting for it to like load or whatever I just thought to myself ""what even do I say is my problem?""   Like I go to one of the best colleges in the US, I'm in a fraternity, all my family is alive, I have a decent amount of money, and yet....I think about killing myself every day.  I've already tried before and ended up in the hospital.     And then I come on here and it's like ""my entire family was murdered when I was 12 and I've been on the streets since then struggling with drug addiction"" and then I'm just like...fuck...what the hell do I have to feel depressed about?   I just feel so alone.  I feel like my entire fraternity just pretends to be my friend, as well as all my friends who aren't in my fraternity.  I have a ""best friend"" who I try and talk to about my problems and I'm like yeah I have depression she's like oh damn that sucks anyway and changes the subject.  I literally feel paranoid just walking around outside, even tho I'm a 6'1 190 pound white dude.  I feel like I'm losing my goddamn mind.  I want to get a dog so I can have someone who I know actually cares about me, but I don't think I can because if I kill myself I dont know who'd take care of it.  So I'm in a weird situation there.  Idk I'm all over the place.  People would kill to be in my situation and here I am wasting my potential by wallowing in self pity all the fucking time, which in turn makes me more depressed.  I'd kill myself right now but my mom and dad would be torn up and I can't do that to them.  I go see a therapist and everything but it doesn't help.  I just don't even really know what to do anymore.  I'm not a guy you'd think would be mentally ill as fuck at first glance, so it's kind of hard to bring up to people, especially when you don't trust them because you think they're pretending to be your friends.  Idk. How do i cope w wanting to kill myself every time I wake up?"	sw
"I really hope I'm gonna kill myself soon. I don't feel sad or depressed anymore. I'm just so mad and upset that I have to keep dealing with this shitty life and shitty family. only thing that's holding me is the fact that my parents paid my expensive college tuition fee. If I die now that'd be a huge waste of money to them. They don't even love me. They just want to show off their kids to others. Please somebody kill me. If it's not suicide it'd be little better maybe. I want everyone to die, I want to die. why some people die from stress and I don't??? I want to write that I'm suicidal on my twiter account but I don't want all the fake sympathy from people who actually don't care so I came here. I don't wanna try...I just wanna die..."	sw

And I am horribly bad at initiating hang out ideas. Luckily we balance each other well. She'll message me and say ""wanna do something"" or something along those lines, I'll agree and when I ask what she had in mind she doesn't know. It's then up to me to plan the activities that we do and at what time. If we tried to reverse this, nothing would ever get done and we'd never see each other.  In the past we tried to trade the brainstormer of the plans back and forth but as time went on we just fell into this routine and it works well for us. I was even the one who picked where we were gonna eat for her birthday celebration this year because she had no idea what she wanted.  We just planned a day trip including getting Mexican food and going to a museum for this weekend. She wanted to do something over spring break but we're both pretty busy with left over school work and our jobs so we had to wait until the last day to do something. It should be fun though. She told me a week or so ago that she hasn't really done much in Manhattan despite the fact that we both go to school in the city so that's how this all started. When I asked her what she wanted to do, she had no idea so I listed out a bunch of options and she chose museum. Then when it came to food I was put in complete charge of that and I picked Mexican because I enjoy it, she wants to try new things, and how can you go wrong with Mexican food?  We've been wanting to go on a trip together for a while now but the plans keep getting pushed aside because of school, money, family stuff, or what have you. Every time we almost plan a trip though it's an insane amount of back and forth trying to pick out all the details in no order. One day we'll figure something out though.   Is there anyone you're good with balancing each other's positive/negative traits like my best friend and me?  Would you say you are more or less adventurous than the people in your daily life?  How good are you at brain storming ideas for things to do?

"Where do I go from here? As of right now, every morning I wake up and immediately think about killing myself. My last thought before falling asleep is in regards to my own death. In between those two points of my day, I am wracked with anxiety to the point that I cannot breathe normally, my heart feels like it will explode and I cannot think clearly. At least 4 times a day my thoughts start to race and they feel out of control. They often enter paranoid and irrational territory. I have been drinking more lately, a lot more, in fact I spent from 9:00AM to midnight this past Sunday intoxicated. I have been going out and drinking so much that I do very embarrassing and dangerous things, and sometimes only have vague memories of doing those things. Speaking of vague memories, I feel like I am losing the ability to remember things. Each yesterday seems made up. Or I have a thought, and I cannot remember if I have already expressed it. I wish I had a better way of explaining that, but just imagine that literally every 10 minutes, you can't remember if anything you did before ACTUALLY happened. This is all starting to take a toll on my ability to keep myself together for work. I work as an administrator for a preschool, so I need to be on top of my game and at least seemingly cheery for 9+ hours a day. Recently my coworkers have been asking me if I was okay, implying that it seems like I am on some sort of drugs because I talk... Weird? I guess? Like if my guard is down I don't make sense and slur my words, or I am talking very loudly and very quickly. If I am focused I can talk fine, but if I just clocked out or am not around students it's like I cannot will myself to interact regularly. My sleeping is all over the place. I either go 3 days without more than a couple of hours of sleep from staying out, or I come home after school and sleep for 14 hours a few days in a row. Regarding medical background, the last medication I was on was lamictal, which was months ago for mood regulation. I was hospitalized once back in 2013 for a suicide attempt, and have since tried most of the major antidepressants which either caused me to rapidly cycle or didn't work for me. I don't have money to see a doctor right now (or at least I dont have the mental capacity to make money management happen to visit a doctor) and I am terrified of having to go on new meds, or worse being hospitalized again and risk ruining everything I have built over the past 5 years. I live a state away from my family, currently don't have any friends close by, recently split from my SO, and feel super isolated. I WANT to die, but I know I'm not supposed to feel that way. So what do I do with this? Where do I go from here? I am physically in pain from my anxiety and depression, I cannot remember to do things like shower, I am getting paranoid thoughts, the only things that make my life slightly less terrible are drinking and whatever drugs I can get my hands on. I just want this all to stop."	sw
"I have a favorite communal mug at work. In your opinion, is it okay to take it home if I bring a replacement of equal quality? I wouldn't want to just take the mug, but if I leave one in its place is that wrong? The communal mugs are non-matching, this one just happens to be my favorite.  EDIT: Now that I know who made the mug, I've decided to buy myself an identical one. Thanks for your help with this moral dilemma."	cc
"A reason to be proud Seeing this subreddit makes me smile, anyone that posts here should be proud of themselves, instead of taking the easy but unsatisfying way out, you've all decided to seek help, maybe some people are too shy or scared to talk about suicide with people in real life, so it is understandable to talk about this anonymously on the internet. I've seen some poeple here say that others talking to them won't make them feel better and that this subreddit is useless, thing is, you might not feel comfort talking to strangers, the point is to see some light, a bit of hope, some ideas of motivations and goals. I hope you can all find a reason to give life another chance.✌️🙏👍"	sw
Coincidental Birthdays and zodiac signs I seem to meet people who are frends or coworkers that have the same birthdays often. I know 5 people with the same birthday as me and  friends who share same birthdays along with famiy member. A good mentor of mine told me it is a sign that good people are in your life. What are you guys( and ladies) thoughts on that? Has you ever experienced this too?	cc
"The ""Where are you from?"" question I've lived in Australia since I was two years old, but all my life I've been asked by adults ""Where are you from?"". I've always felt that it's an odd question as I don't identify with my country of birth (New Zealand) as I only lived there for two years, and I don't identify with my Pacific Islander heritage.  I've embraced the fact that I truly identify with being Australian as Australia has been my home all of my life. Still, I get asked ""Where are you from?"" to which I always reply ""just down the road from here"" or *insert name of suburb here*. My answer always prompts the follow-up: ""No, where are you *from*?"" To which I often respond: ""Do you mean: what's my background? Or what's my cultural heritage?""  I do feel pretty cheeky giving such responses, but I wonder how other people feel about this sort of question - it's always been a nit-pick of mine in any conversation starter.   Do you use this question/how do you guys feel when you are asked this (especially the follow-up repeat question with the odd emphasis on ""from"")? How do people respond when you use this question/how do you respond when you are asked this?"	cc
"Anyone want to talk? I’m stuck on a plane, and would love to hear from some similarly bored redditers.   Tell me about something that’s going on with you, ask me some stuff, whatever works.

"Tired of how my friends can recklessly spend their money but not the same for me An episode of Friends perfectly summed it up, how certain friends in the group have a lot more money to spend than others and then they’d like to do lots of expensive activities and when me and my other friend can’t afford it, they donate money or buy me the ticket and it feels like charity. Things like fair tickets, bowling, and paint ball all usually cost $40-60 and I don’t have that kinda money. My situation is that I’m 14 and I can’t get a job or an allowance. My moms been super stressed lately and asking for a $60 fair ticket really makes it worse, I feel horrible asking my mom for double digit money numbers after she’s worked a 12 hour shift and has come home tired and sad. My mom has the money but I hate asking for it, makes me feel spoiled and bratty. Another example is Fortnite, all my friends and me play it and I haven’t spent a dime on it meanwhile my friends have all the skins and emotes, ect....  They’re always picking on me how I have nothing. My friends think I’m dirt poor which I’m not, I just don’t like asking for all this money, which isn’t really going towards the most necessary thing in the world. My friends are like “Hey man I can give you $3, I really hope you can get $2 from somewhere” And “Why don’t you have any Fortnite skins?” “is it because you can’t afford it? I know they’re just trying to be nice, but’s it’s humiliating and it’s charity, and it’s not even the truth!! I’m not poor at all. "	cc

"Trying to figure out how to face another day So I've been trying to convince myself I'm OK but I can't keep up the charade any longer.  I've been living a ""good, respectable, responsible"" life for about a year now, but I don't know how to do it any more.  The problems in my life are so complicated and confusing regarding legal and family mess that I won't begin to try to explain my current situation.  Just know that it's killing me inside, and I've been trying my hardest to figure out solutions, and I just don't think there are any.  I've seen a ton of different p-docs and therapists, been on just about every combo of meds you can think of, and even been in inpatient care 7 times over the course of my life.  I finally just had to stop taking any meds, because they weren't helping.  Toward the end of my time on meds, the combo I was on was sedating me so badly that I kept falling asleep during the day and had no motivation, and my family berated me over how worthless and lazy and selfish I was.  Then, my doc changed my meds and I suddenly started having homicidal thoughts.  I gave up and quit all the meds.  And p-docs and therapists kept using my same-sex attraction as a symptom of mental illness or as a sign of downright moral failure.  (Yeah, I'm a lesbian.)  One doctor mocked me, one told me I was on my way to Hell, one told me he was good at ""fixing"" people like me, one ""crisis case manager"" even prayed over me and insisted that I study the Bible.  For my own safety, I have to hide my sexual orientation from my family and most people I know.  I'm 40 years old and haven't even so much as kissed a woman in nearly 20 years.  My life has been a jumble of abuse, rape, suicide attempts, self-harm, a home invasion involving two dudes with a shotgun, hallucinations, panic attacks, a few life-threatening health crises (aside from the suicide attempts), and the list just keeps going.  I look back and realize that there are large chunks of my life that I can't remember.  I see photos that I'm in or that I took and can't recognize them. Lately, more and more, the people around me seem strange and alien.  My surroundings grow louder and more chaotic every day, and everything seems to move faster and faster, and it feels like it's all coming toward me.  I start to twitch sometimes because it physically hurts me and makes my mind kind of short-circuit when all the sounds and motion and lights get to be overwhelming, but I have to try to suppress it because years ago a p-doc supposedly told my mom that I do things like that on purpose to try to get attention and pity, so my family can get really disgusted with me if they see it.  I don't recognize my own face in the mirror, I don't recognize my own voice.  Nothing seems real anymore, and sometimes I even feel sort of like I'm coming out of my body.  No, it's not drugs ... I have smoked marijuana ONCE in the past 16 years, and I can't remember ever doing any actual bad drug.  (And before those 16 years, back when I was younger,  I think I only ever smoked week 3 times altogether.) When I try to remember things in the past, my chronology gets all out of order and there are discontinuities and things that seem impossible.  In life and reality, in general, there are so many contradictions and absurdities, it just feels like reality can't be ... real.  I just want to escape.  I don't really want to be dead, but I want to be somewhere that makes sense.  And maybe there just isn't such a place.  And being where I am now makes so little sense that I feel like there's this unspeakable and eternal scream of wordless horror inside my chest.  Like, all the assumptions that we make about how reality works, about how things supposedly have some sort of order and reason and logic, I feel like maybe all those assumptions are just wrong and i feel like ""Reality"" could just BREAK any minute and then where the hell would I end up?  Maybe it's slowly breaking already.  Really, I think it might help to just have some quiet alone time for a while, get some rest, but I can't miss work, and even when I'm not at work, I'm dealing with my insane family,  and my home is so effing loud, and at work it's utterly insane because my company is falling apart and I'm expected to do the work of several people while still also being super peppy and convincing all our customers to buy a ton of stuff they don't want, and my boss is a terrible person who makes her employees miserable and I'm just so so so so tired.  EDIT/UPDATE:   It's a day later now.  Today, I had a great day.  Worked my ass off at work and accomplished a lot.  It made me feel a lot better.  I think I'll be OK, for now.  Thanks for reading."	sw
I dont think I can do it anymore All I ever do is break my promises. I promised my mom I would get straight As that I would do my best and get better. Its April now and I have two Ds in my classes and a paper due two weeks ago that was a good portion of my grade. I wanted to prove that I could make it. I lived only to see the world change and for the love of my family.   I'm 17 and yet I feel like I've reached the end of my line. I won't get into a good college like I have always hoped or get a good job. I wanted something a cause to die for but I might have to settle for this.  My first suicide attempt was April of last year and I can't stop thinking about it. I'd have to clean my room first. All I can say is I'm afraid and I'm sorry to my family.	sw
"after six failed suicide attempts, I plan on jumping off a bridge. I cant live anymore. I am 14y male with adhd anxiety and severe depression. I have attempted suicide 6 times and i plan on jumping of a 46 meters high bridge. I feel out of place from crowds of people. I have been depressed for as long as i can remember, but before i didn't recognize this to be depression and always said to myself i am just 'calm' or emotionless. I don't know if i should talk with my friends about this. They seem to like having me around but we aren't that close to each other. I have other friends that i don't hang around with anymore as they aren't really good friends, so i hang around the other guys. I don't know who i should talk to. I already know how big of an asshole i am for trying to kill myself regardless of how it would make people feel, that's all i have been told from rehab after the sixth time i tried to kill myself. Antidepressants have failed and have said have likely made me even more depressed. I tried everything i just feel either the same or worse. My mom is always yelling at me for being this depressed piece of shit. My dad threatens to call the cops on me for locking myself in my room (I don't even understand how he thinks that will work). There is a good fucking reason I am behind this locked door you assholes. My older sister seems to be the only one who loves me sometimes. She understands the pain i am going through and she knows what its like to be depressed. She gone through what i did and is recovering from depression after a failed suicide attempt. She used to tell me how she wanted to kill her self and i would always talk her out of suicidal plans and help her from physical, mental and verbal abuse from my parents. She is recovering now but i don't know if i will ever recover. Even if i move out from my parents I would still feel the same. I don't feel hope for myself in the future. I plan on jumping off a 46 meters high bridge that will result in a high chance of death. I don't know what i should do. Should i talk with my friends with this? I don't know what should i do. I hate being alive. I really don't see it getting better and i want it to end now."	sw
"I’ve finally found things in my life that make me happy. I love acting and singing, I love psychology and everything about it and how fascinating it is. I am a lead in a musical, never thought it would happen. I am headed to a great college. It sucks that I had to wait until my senior year to realize all of this, but we all have to start somewhere. I’m finally happy. When this shows over though, I might be a little depressed but that’s okay. I will find something else to do. I am finally the happiest I’ve been."	cc
"Telling my parents I’m suicidal Hi. 14F here.   I want to die - why else would I be here? I burst into tears at sports practice, there’s a voice in my head constantly harassing me, I fantasize about my death and how it would affect others every day. I want people to miss me. I want everybody to realize how much (or little) I mean(t) to them.   I know this isn’t healthy or normal. I’m seeing a therapist now, which is neat. My parents brought me to therapy at my request but I didn’t tell them what for. I don’t want to give them the burden.  I don’t want to explain why I feel so bad to them.   My parents lead very busy, stressful lives as it is. They work in law, which is a tiring field to be in. The family dog is sick and lethargic right now.  They’re redoing the house and have to make a lot of decisions. There’s so much stuff on their plates right now, I don’t want to distract them from it and add more to worry about. I don’t want to break my mom’s heart.   I’ve told them before I felt like I want to end my life but quickly took it back saying I would never do it and I was being hyperbolic. But that was months ago, and now it’s getting worse. Sometimes I really do think about doing it, ideas like hanging myself on a basketball hoop structure at school or tying my feet to a heavy concrete block or rock to drown myself in the pool pop into my head often. I’m starting to get scared I will really do it someday. It gets overwhelming sometimes at school and I spend my lunch period crying. I used to blame it on just being a dumb angsty teenager but it hurts a lot now.   I told my therapist (my first time going was two days ago) and she listened. It was nice, the thing is I can only see her like once a month since her schedule is so busy. It got worse after I talked to her about it and it kinda sucks that I have to wait until May to discuss it more.   I have a meeting with a psychologist for medicine, which I’m kinda worried about. I don’t want any scary side effects, who knows maybe I’m just being dramatic and I don’t really need it.   I don’t want to tell my friends, I’m sure they have a lot to deal with too in their lives and I don’t want to scare them away. It’s not like therapy anyways where they’re bound by law not to tell anybody.   I don’t know what to do. I don’t feel good. "	sw

Hello redditors, near enough every night whilst trying to go to sleep I find myself thinking about things I did in the past, girlfriends, friends, things I got up to, mistakes I made, everything and anything really.

"Roller coaster of feelings, still a month of waiting... Hello, I'm gonna keep it short I've had a very bad phase around 5 years ago when I was 16 where I barely could leave home for 2 years but I'm somewhat very fine now cause I'm fully focusing on work.  Still I had some sort of audition a few weeks ago, and I feel like I wasn't very good and I have to wait a month before the first results. I'm fully focusing on work (around 80 hours a week) and suicide is an ever-present thought if I can't even succeed in my work when everything else in my life is a mess.  I know I probably won't ever commit suicide, but I just have to get this out cause it's driving me insane."	sw

"I wand to die, but I don’t want to kill my self. I’m 18 years old, have about a month and a half left of high school, and my life has completely fallen to shit. My life has lost all meaning and nothing brings me joy anymore. I’ve spent over half of my life in Scouts and I have worked towards, and achieved, a goal that I cherish, but one which society doesn’t care about or admire anymore, that of Eagle Scout. The only thing that I have ever been truly good at, my instrument, I am getting progressively worse at, even though I practice every day. The last time that I experienced true happiness and elation was on New Year’s, three whole months ago. My friends don’t really acknowledge my presence anymore unless I initiate contact first, or I’m visually distressed and broken down crying. Wherever I am, I always have something on me, just in case I do decide to do it, but I don’t know what stops me every time I think about ending it all, why I don’t.

"I'm lucky I don't come from a gun family I'm really lucky there are no guns anywhere near me that I have access to. I can be perfectly fine one second and then the next second, I can be verbalizing the ways in which I would kill myself. If I had a gun that I had access to, I might've already done it. I've had some pretty low lows. Whether my reasons for being as sad as I have been are legitimate or not, I'd probably say they're first world problems. But if I see a certain family member or remember a certain ""real world"" problem that I'm facing, I just get these reckless thoughts about killing myself. I'm still not tending to myself (my teeth are so sensitive it keeps me up at night sometimes, I haven't showered in a couple weeks) and my appetite just keeps getting bigger and bigger and I keep getting lazier and lazier.

"I want to do/make something for my SO since he's been taking care of me during my surgery recovery Hi all, first time poster. I recently had a major back surgery, an artificial disc replacement. I am 21 and my SO is 22, and we have been together for 6 years. He has been taking such good care of me, helping me dress, get around, making sure I take my medicines on time, cooking for me, etc all with zero hesitation. I would do the same for him in a heartbeat but I have surgeries fairly often and I would like to do something special, since this is not the first recovery he has helped me through.  I could always buy him something, he loves video games like I do, and work tools as he is an electrician.

"So I've got my own sigil now My friend 100% believes in the paranormal. Spirits, curses, mind reading, horoscopes, etc. You name it she believes in it. I personally don't but it's pretty fun to talk about and it normally doesn't get in the way of normal life.  Last night she and one of her friends played with an ouija board. She says that it attracted a ton of malevolent spirits and that if I came over to hang out tonight I'd be at risk. I didn't care because fuck ghosts, went over and had fun talking and playing on a rope swing.  When I was getting ready to leave she stopped me and told me I had to make a sigil to keep me safe from the spirits after I left her house.  ...What?  Long story short, she told me to design a symbol that used N, P, C, D, and G, draw it on a special stone, and do some other stuff to ""activate it"". She told me that I'm now resistant to malevolent spirits and that I could drive home safe. Cool.

"Messed up   I feel a bit hopeless at the moment. I’ve had depression in the past, and have been on sertraline for about 4years. I started college this year, met an incredible group of friends, and have generally been feeling great about things. I even lowered my dose from 150mg to 100mg. But then I went and messed it all up.   I betrayed my girlfriend of 3 years. I slept with my close guy friend who I work with and go to college with. I told her, and we went on a short break to think about everything. I kept messaging him, even though I KNEW I shouldn’t. I constantly changed my mind on what I wanted; I told him that I wanted to be with him. We sent nudes and talked about what we wanted to do to each other.   Then I changed my mind again. I realised that what I have  with my girlfriend is worth trying to save. She’s my best friend. I feel sick knowing that I’ve betrayed her trust again. I haven’t told her this time. We were technically on a break but I still feel like a monster. Her friend threatened me, telling me he’d hurt me if I upset her again. He’s a big guy with violent tendencies, so this was a bit worrying...   I’ve been feeling suicidal. I know I won’t do anything too drastic, but I really need some support. I hate seeing councillors because I feel like they never help, so I came here.  I guess these are my main problems:  1.  I have college in a few days and I don’t know who I’ll sit with because my girlfriend (understandably) doesn’t want me seeing him. 2.  I don’t know how to deal with the guilt of betraying her twice, and if she ever found out idk what I would do. 3.  I’m going to miss him. He was a good friend. Plus I really hurt him by telling him I wanted to be with him and then changing my mind.  If anyone has any advice I would really appreciate it. I really need some support. Thanks guys "	sw

"Loss is not a single moment. Loss is not a single moment, loss is amassing. It's the sound of your son crying in the back seat of the car when you finally get the guts to leave. It's the sound of your own violent crying when they tell you that you have to give him to the man who bruises you. It's the sound of the person you love calling you a liar. It's the sound of the last 6 months flying past as if you're in stop motion. It's the sound of everything you've fought so hard for, and built from the ground up crashing into itself around you.  It's the taste of blood in your mouth. It's the taste of the birthday cake you made for yourself and that half a bottle of rum you drank to turn that agony into a dull ache, coming back up violently.  It's the way the shadows from the trees move on the ceiling, you're sure they're arms and they're waiting to take you. To shove themselves into your body just like he did the night you wished he'd just finally fucking killed you instead.  Loss is not a single moment, a single taste, sight, or sound. Loss is amassing. Loss is your entire life."	sw
"25000 mg I'm lying on the couch debating with myself if I should take 25000 mg of acetaminophen and see what happens. I know I can stomach 35 pills, but can I stomach 50? I'd like to find out. Then I'd like to let it all sit, not freak out this time. How long would it take acute liver failure to set in? A few days to a week, I would imagine. Painful, but I'm not sure that I care about that. I would most likely die... am I okay with that? On one hand, help may be on the horizon.

"It's My Bday and I Want to Die Tomorrow is my 32nd birthday, and I want to commit suicide. I've had these thoughts since I was about 8 or 9, and I'm feeling tired and very meaningless. It's getting harder and harder to fight the thoughts. I have a young son (2 years old) and he's the only reason I haven't done it yet. Now I am thinking that if I want to do something this traumatic, maybe I should do it before he is old enough to remember me and how much of a fuck up I am.  I am considering doing it on my birthday because I am tired of living and seeing new years come and go with the same depressed, meaningless life. I am ""successful"" I guess by other people's definition - I'm a librarian and actually like my job, I have a boyfriend and a son, and we have a home. But my boyfriend is emotionally withdrawn (he uses affection and emotion like currency) and treats me differently from day-to-day. I am starting to buckle under the pressure of being the primary caregiver (financial and physical), and all I see stretched out before me is a numb life of catering to others. I feel very disposable and like there may be something better - more peaceful - in death. Just wanted to share just in case I actually go through with this."	sw

"Not temporary I feel like every time I talk to someone or I seek help on a website, I’m told that my suicidal thoughts are a permanent solution to a temporary problem. But this isn’t temporary.

I’ve tried therapy, medication, treatment... it all just numbs the feelings. When I want to cry and I can’t get tears out and I know it’s just because the medication stops the tears but not the underlying hatred I have of myself. No one likes me and I understand why.

"Growing up isn’t what I expected it to be Anyone else remember being younger and wishing you could be a “grown up”. Wishing you could do everything adults could and all because everything they did just looked like a ton of fun. And then you grow up and learn that adult life isn’t as fun as what you thought it was.  (This is long, but there won’t be a tldr, sorry)  I remember being a kid, about 10. And I would play on a soccer team in my town that would travel around the state and play other teams. We would practice at our local high school’s soccer field every night. And some nights a high school soccer player would show up to say hi to the coach or to practice with us for fun. And my team would sometimes watch high school soccer games on the weekends. And back then high school seemed like it was a ton of fun and everyone looked a lot older and mature. It was cool if you were in high school. But now that I’m there and almost out of high school, I am realizing that I am what younger me wanted to be. I’m a high schooler. But it’s not as fun as I thought it would be. Sure there are a lot of times when it’s really fun, but as I was sitting here a minute ago trying to write a 2000 word essay, which 8 years ago I would’ve freaked out about, I realized that I’ve really grown up. But maybe adulthood won’t be what I’m expecting it to be right now."	cc

"I'm in this stage of my life where I am moving from 'college student' to 'working adult' and things are a lot more complicated then I thought. I had a really great time in college: academically successful, socially active, and a schedule that allowed for lots of personal freedom. In December, I graduated and a few months later, landed my dream job. I'm not complaining- I am excited for my new career and taking  a break from university; but, I don't think I was ready for the things that come with submerging into adult life, like only being free after 5 and on weekends or not being able to see my college friends as much. It feels a lot better than moving from teenager to college student, I have more of a sense of who I am and what I want, but the more rigid structure in my schedule and distance from my friends has made me a little blue.   Anyone else going through a similar experience? Let's get *existential*!   Edit: sorry about any spelling/grammar errors. I use a lot of brain power at my job and become sloppy after 5 PM. "	cc
"I don't see the fucking point anymore. I wrote tons here on why i'm suicidal. My anger. My sadness. Just generally a lot of self pitying. Somehow expecting my ramble to end with me picking out something that'll make me want to stay. It didn't work. I've had Depression and Anxiety for about seven years now.  Back in January of this year, i attempted to take my own life via overdose. However an online friend of mine convinced me to go to the hospital and i can honestly say it's been the worst decision i have ever made in my life.   I suffer from so much self-hatred. There is nothing i like about myself and there will never be. Even from when i was a kid, there wouldn't be one thing i could say i'm proud of. And over the years, there's just been more and more flaws that take over. I try and sit myself down and say ""No, Calm down, This is just the depression talking. You're not a terrible person"", but at this point i just don't give a fuck anymore.   I haven't got any hobbies - or hobbies that actually make me happy. I used to feel as if i could get somewhere with my art and animation career, but now i literally couldn't care less if i tried. Whenever somebody says ""Why don't you try do something that makes you happy?"", i smile and nod but what the fuck is there for me to do? I've tried quite a few new things, but i just get more and more depressed and frustrated, leaving it better if i just do nothing. Which i know is wrong.   I think the main thing affecting my mood at the moment is my friends. I'm a really compassionate person, and i go above and beyond to try and prove to people how much i care and am willing to try my hardest to make somebody smile. I don't usually get the same kind of response - which i usually say is okay. But i think it's really affecting me mentally.  I have one real life friend, Who is only really friends with me because they haven't got anybody else to hang about with in the day. In freetime, they aren't very interested to talk and hang out.   Online, i have (or had.) quite a few friends. But there's been a cycle that always happens to me, without fail. Six times. The 'cycle' goes as follows;  * I meet a person/people and become friends with them.  * I become especially good friends with 1/2 people involved. * The other person shows me the same kind of effort that i put in. * The other person meets a few other people, i try to get involved however am not usually as welcomed. * the small things the other person used to do to show me that they cared no longer happens.  * the other person tends not to enjoy conversation/respond much/excessive anger/disinterest * The other person only really speaks to me out of pity.   I know this sounds selfish and stupid. But i can literally give you six examples of this happening. Pretty much to the exact same formula.   I fight to try and keep people in my life, of course, but i'm not the type of person who gets aggressive about it. I try desperately to prove how much i care and that i'm good enough, though it usually falls under deaf ears. Until I eventually give in and just say ""Well, they're happier and better off without me. It's okay i'll meet new people.""  The thing is. Everybody is better off without me. And after the sixth time for this heartbreak and genuine emotional turmoil, i don't want to try again. I don't want to be lulled into another false sense of security only to be shot in the heart again and again.   I wish i had somebody who would go the extra mile. Who'd tell me ""hey, it's going to be okay"" rather than ignoring me until they can be like ""are you better now?""  I think i'm going to end my life before the summer. I've been staying for my friends and stuff, but it's really clear to me that i'm just going to hurt myself more and more watching them fade. I'm going to wait until i know for certain that they'll be okay - i'm sort of at that point now but. Idk.   I'm sorry for this post. I just needed to talk. It sounds so selfish in reptrospect, and i understand that. But i don't ever get to say. I just want to talk about why i'm done with my life and why the only thing i'm looking forward to is ending it."	sw

"I set fire to everything I touch I have lost all hope, and I have no where else to turn. I have no friends to talk to, and I haven’t spoken to my family in almost 2 years.    Basically I have suffered from depression in some form since I was around 13. I will be 31 on Sunday and I can’t take it anymore.  I can’t remember a time in my life where my parents ever hugged me or gave me any affection, and the have never told me they loved me. However they have told me how much of a loser I am, and been overly critical of everything I have ever done. So realizing that they were toxic for me, I ceased all communication with them, and forfeit any ideas that they would ever change.  They last 3 or 4 years, things have just gotten unbearable for me. I think the depression flared up in a major way when my wife miscarried our first child. The whole situation really sent me into a downward spiral that I have yet to recover from. That event brought a lot of stress and problems into our marriage. During that time, I began seeing a physiatrist and also began taking medication. This seemed to help somewhat with my mood, but it also introduced side effects and I began the carousel of medication changes.  About a year later we got pregnant again, and later my daughter was born. I really feel like my depression robbed me of that euphoric feeling of endless love for your child that everyone describes. I really felt nothing, although I know I was “supposed” to love her.  Soon after (2 months) my daughter was born, my wife could not take living with a depressed person any more and she decided to move out with her mother, and we separated.  I continued to go to therapy, and my phycologist, to try and improve my symptoms, and get my family back. For the next six months things just seemed to get worse between us, and it all led me to a suicide attempt. It failed obviously, but it led me to be hospitalized in a psychiatric unit, were I was once again but on diffent meds.   Through all of this I continued therapy after getting out, and eventually convinced my wife to do couples therapy, all in hopes I would get my only friend back, and be able to bond and build a relationship with my young daughter.  She eventually decided to file for divorce. She said it was to protect or daughter, from me being able to get her at anytime. She wanted legal print in place for protection basically. Obviously my condition continued to deteriorate, but we were still trying to work on things. I voluntarily checked myself into a different, highly acclaimed, physiatrist hostpital to try and address my suicidal feelings and depression I had been suffering from the past several years.  Once again, things got momentarily better, but soon after I was still feeling the same and having the same thoughts of harming myself.  This pattern continued and eventually she finalized the divorce, I was hospitalized again, I lost my wife, and my daughter. She got the courts to agree that I am unable to see my daughter without supervision. So basically I can’t be alone with her. It makes it very difficult to do since I have no friends, and the only family I have that I speak to and that cares about me is my 80 year old grandmother.  During this time I also was looked over for a promotion at work that I told I was going to get but didn’t.  I have never given up hope that we could get back together and we would be able to be a family, and I would get better and get to be close to my daughter.  But to top it all off, I just found out my ex wife has now began dating someone new. She was my only friend, and now that she is seeing someone, she keeps conversation strictly to our now 2 year old daughter.   So the only 2 people I have in this world is my daughter, who won’t even hug me. And my grandmother, and when I lose her I don’t know what I will do.   I have thought about suicide multiple times a day for as long as I can remember. It’s really the only thing that could end the pain. I am not an easy person to get along with and I have so little self worth, and no redeeming qualities, that I truly believe my daughter would be much better off without me. Especially if I were to go now while she is young and has formed no memories of me.  I’m really just rambling at this point, and it is probably a wall of text, but I have no where else to turn, as I have since given up on meds and therapy and have just become a, resentful, bitter, depressed and suicidal person who is literally unlovable."	sw

"13 years of suffering, 2018 takes the cake The past 13 years have been tainted with mental illness. I've had diagnosis upon diagnosis and treatment, upon treatment.   From Anxiety to panic attacks to agoraphobia to major depression to general anxiety to adhd to borderline personality to obsessive compulsive personality to adjustment disorder. Nothing has ever lasted.  I'm exhausted  Ever since high school I feel like i've been stuck in this wheel of life repeating itself every 2-3 years for the past 13 years, but 2018 takes the cake.  In the last 3 months, my dog died, my boyfriend for the past 8 years dumped me just as we were finally planing to have kids, his idea, I was taken advantage of at work and I haven't been able to go back without crying all the time and now my mother has cancer (we just don't know how bad yet). Somehow the fact that I was to celebrate my 30th birthday this year makes it all worst, i'n not getting any younger and time feels like a waste...  My world is falling appart.  Then it doesn't help that i've been having these crippling neck pains. My whole face is painful from all my nerves extremities flairing up, the pain runs so deep that i've had tinnitus going on since October. I even did physio to the point of emptying my bank account without any lasting results.  I've been to the emergency twice, being scared of commiting suicide. Scared because I don't want to hurt my parents, they're helpful as much as they can. Because I don't want to hurt my little sister who is also struggling and looking up to me.   Because I don't want anybody find my me and have my mutilated body seared into their retina. Because a part of me still has hope, but to which price?   The price of living this life with all that emotional baggage of the past 13 years (and pilling up) is incredibly scary to me.  The price of wondering, will I ever be ok again? And if i'm not, it'll be only to die with a lifetime of regrets and lost moments because of all the crippling diseases that have taken over my life...  I'm slowly accepting that I am probably done here. I've had my best years and maybe it's time to cherish these memories of better days all while saying goodbye to these current terrible ones..."	sw
I am not sure how much longer i can cope for. The voice telling me to end everything is getting deafeningly loud. Please excuse the word rubbish that will follow here. I cant think straight really. I guess I should give context but I dont know. I really think I want to die but I cant tell if i do or not. I am under so much stress.... My Mum died last year. I really miss her and want to be with her.  I have just had to move out of my home because my siblings are selling it. I’ve moved into a house share but all i want to do is go home. And i can never go home again now.  Things are not going well at my new job and my depression is getting in the way of me being able to do my job properly.  My boyfriend is potentially about to have another manic breakdown. He said he was feeling really manic today. I don’t think i could cope with him going into hospital again.  And my friend who is back visiting said he’d call to see me at 7pm. Its 8.30 pm now and so I guess i am not worth seeing.  I feel like I have been sitting on my hands all week. I just want to make it all stop now. Everything feels awful. I miss my mum so much and I can’t cope without her. I don’t feel like I can tell my family that I am not coping.  The suicidal thoughts are so so so loud in my head and they are there all the time at the moment. I really really don’t know what to do. I just want to go home to my Mum and thats really not possible now.   I am just in so much pain and the temptation to hurt myself or end my life is really big. 	sw

I pay for my bills, save money l, and still have money for essentials yet haters gonna hate I guess, even if theyre family.  What is something you spend so much moola on?"	cc
"Toughts on death all the time. I made this Alt account just to post this. I think of death all the time. It's either that, or thinking about all the massive fuckups my life has been up to this point. Sometimes listening to sad music of dubious quality. I don't find comfort in anything or anyone. It's fun to think that just 3 months ago I was the luckiest person from my point of view. A loving girlfriend, a caring best friend, and just about a good life. When my gf told me she never loved me and we should part ways, I collapsed. Then, who the fuck knows why, I told my best friend I liked them. And I didn't. I really don't know why I said it. I was really close to my GF, but now it seems it was all bullshit. With my best friend, it's just fucking hillarious how she used to comfort me and talking to me everyday, to just no contact at all. My life's a mess now. I got no real friends. My ex and my Best friend hang out everyday at college now, while I suffer alone and cry myself to sleep everynight. I cut myself on multiple ocassions. And my family found a suicide note I wrote the other day. I just can't stand life anymore."	sw
I don’t want to live I fell in love with a girl. We dated for a while. She died in a car accident. I fell in love with another. She hates me now. I’ve been diagnosed with GAD and depression. The only thing keeping me sane at this point is the copious amounts of benzos I’ve been taking. I’m 19 and don’t have a job or even a drivers license. I’m living off of my dad who has enough trouble as it is paying for his divorce with my mom. I dropped out of school in grade 11 because the depression and anxiety were so bad I couldn’t go without having a panic attack the whole day. I want to die but as an atheist. I’m terrified of the void that I believe awaits me. And I’m left considering if it’s any worse than what my life is now. Idk if anyone will read this. Or care if they do. But I’ve pushed all my real friends away and just need to get this out to someone who might understand. Thanks for your time. 	sw

"This is my suicide note. I'll just start and say thank you to my two most caring friends, I loved you guys. You all helped me through my suicide attempt. I could say anything to you all. I opened up to one of you about being molested as a kid, and it felt so good to tell you. I can't express how grateful I was for you all. When I was with you all I felt cared for, and I didn't always have my guard up, I felt safe for once....  Red I'm so sorry, I know you had so much hope for me, you wanted to see me get out of where I'm at, you wanted me to get to California. I was so close to 16 and I could go get myself help, im just too fucking weak. Two years of serious depression has took all hope I had left. I hope you make sure you kids have a good life, please make it a million times better than mine was.  Lastly, thank you Reddit. You all on this website have mostly raised me since I was 12, y'all were my parents in a sense. You all made life not suck as much. I would get lost in here for hours just to escape... Special shout-out to r/drugs, you guys helped me to not overdose on accident, I would have died at 13 without you all.  Well, I guess this is the end. I hope if you are feeling down you can get help before you end up like me. Please stay alive like I couldn't. I love you all, goodbye for the last time."	sw
"Online friend sends last message implying suicide and then never replies again I don't know what to do. She has been suicidal and depressed for years, I always told her to reach out but she kept on telling me that mental health care wasn't a thing in her country. I don't know where she is located because she didn't tell me, I don't know her full name, nor anything about her family or friends. She mentioned russia a while ago but when I mentioned it she said she wasn't there anymore. I had to talk her out of multiple attempts throughout our chats but this time she just left a message saying that she is tired and will leave forever. I spammed her with suicide hot lines and messages but she didn't even read them.

A mother shouldn’t want to kill herself I am 24 and a first time mother. She is a little over one and she is my world. I did suffer from depression when I was a bit younger but nothing like this. I have been more sensitive to little things and have been lashing out on my partner and other family members. I sleep about 2-4 hours a night. And really I feel like I’m just feeding an unhealthy relationship. I don’t want to put the blame on anyone so I won’t and I’ll just say that I’m the reason I am unhappy. I don’t think my daughter deserves to have a crazy woman as her mother. Last night I had a whole episode and literally destroyed everything in our bedroom after an argument with my partner. Even made a huge hole in the wall which caused me to sprain my wrist. I have been losing my mind lately and I don’t understand why. I have never had an episode while my daughter is around(she was at my in laws for the night) but I’m scared I am a danger to her. Right now my partner is with his family at the park celebrating Easter and I’m at home staring at all the nice things I destroyed. I want to get help but cannot afford it and in my head I can’t get the idea that I should just take my own life so I don’t have to deal with myself and no one has to deal with me. I know she would hate me forever but at least I saved her from meeting a lunatic. This was just really a lot of rambling in one paragraph because my mind is so scattered at the moment.	sw

"I finally got a Switch I've been wanting to get a Switch for the past couple of months but I never had the funds to pay for it. Recently, I started my paid internship and decided to buy one when I could afford it. I still had to wait a while cause I gave my first paycheck to my parents (Asian tradition...I think?). But I finally saved enough money for it. It's been a bit stressful in school lately so I wanted to treat myself. I went with my boyfriend to Gamestop today and bought a used switch since it was a bit cheaper. He offered to buy the game and he didn't let me take no for an answer. I wanted to get Breath of the Wild but I knew that he really wanted to play Mario Odyssey so I chose that so we could play together. He has had a lot of stress too lately.

"Recently adopted the minimal texting lifestyle, now concerned I'm seen as indifferent I used to text/Gchat with my two friends everyday. Would text my nieces at least every few days and when online dating I'd try to keep a consistent texting cadence. Then in all honesty a guy I was into didn't text back the same and that would drive me nuts. After a few weeks I realized that my texting lifestyle and expectations weren't healthy. So I changed and only text to make meet in person. Only kept the same with my nieces bc they are family and want to be involved in their lives. It was hard to change and now I find it odd to text a few times a day.    However, I started to online date again. The individuals I hit it off don't text often with me and I only really text to set up next date. I am now wondering if it might come off as not being interested in them.

For a number of reasons, I’ve never felt like me with the name I was born with, but I was always too terrified to tell my father I intended to legally change it. That’s always been my problem, I probably got it from my mother - she’s the same way; we’re far too worried about the happiness of those around us and never worried enough about our own. But today I did it. I confronted my dad and told him about my intentions to do so and it actually went well. We’ve never really had a great relationship so I was scared he’d freak out a bit, after all identity is something that is still confusing for a lot of people, especially the older generations.  For once in a very long time, I’m happy with who I am and I’m very excited to know that in a little around a months time, I’ll finally be who I’ve always been.  😁"	cc

"Emails (#94) ^^^^I ^^^^think ^^^^this ^^^^is ^^^^the ^^^^shortest ^^^^time ^^^^between ^^^^two ^^^^posts ^^^^I've ^^^^had ^^^^so ^^^^far  Prior to the end of of the spring 2017 semester, I was always on top of all my emails. I hated seeing the little red number notification on my email icon on my laptop or my old iPod touch. As soon as I would get an email from someone, I would reply. I was always very diligent with keeping up with everything.  Then I had to start thinking about my capstone and I had to be in contact with my capstone mentor but that (still to this day when my draft is due tomorrow) felt too overwhelming so I pushed it off and started checking my emails less and less. When I got my new iPod Touch I even deleted the email app from it because I didn't want the constant reminders of my laziness. When I turned on my laptop for the first three years of college I would open the email app and the internet browser as soon as my laptop turned on. Now I haven't opened my email app in months because I'm afraid of the scolding emails saying I should be doing this or that. I still check my emails in the web browser occasionally. I just checked and I have 54 unread emails in my personal email and 29 unread in my college email. That's a lot for me. Most of them are things I consider spam that really aren't, and only one or two are things I should actually care about. When I am done stressing about my school work and being reprimanded for not doing well I do plan on getting back into my habit of checking my emails religiously like in the past.   I never understood how people could just let unread (or even read emails) pile up to the thousands. I had a friend with over 20,000 unread emails. For me, I read the emails, reply if necessary, and then delete them from my inbox if they aren't important enough to keep. Some I'll save into other folders or just keep in my inbox until after a specific date. Every now and then I'll clear out my deleted emails folder and my other folders as well when things are no longer needed in my life.   I hate getting the automatic list-server emails from companies after buying something from them or signing up for some other service on their website. I also hate getting spam after spam from organizations repeatedly when I don't even know how I got on their list to begin with. I have no idea how many email lists I've unsubscribed from over the years. At some point I was getting so much spam in my inbox it took over the emails I needed to get. The only organization I wont unsubscribe from is the company that took my high school graduation photos. They'll still email me once every couple of months asking me to buy the photos even though I graduated in 2014.  When I was around middle school, even though there was AIM, Facebook, and texting, my main way of keeping in contact with a lot of people was via email. Even my grandma! I still have a very small handful of those old emails saved and I wish I had more just so I could look back and see what stupid shit my friends and I would share with each other that seemed so important at 11 years old.   When I m working in the office I have an email relating to the theater that I keep very organized. I didn't set up this email since I wasn't the first assistant my manager has had, so there are tons of emails from before I started working in the office. When I first started there were a large amount of unread emails (over 700) and lots of useless emails in the inbox. I asked my manager if I could go through them and delete what was no longer needed. She showed me which types of emails I should keep and what weren't necessary anymore so I went through all of them until it was all nice and neat. Only a few months ago did it dawn on my to make separate folders for the old emails. Now I have a folder for all the emails before my time, and folders for each six month contract since the older emails aren't important unless the client returns to the theater. Also with this email I do not check it at all unless I am in the office and getting paid. My manager has realized this and, despite her workaholic personality, has accepted that I wont reply to anything when I am not in the office. If something is urgent she'll either text me and email my personal email. I didn't do this so much when I first started working in the office and I felt some of the stress from work carry me home but once I took a hard stance with this approach, things got better.  How many unread emails do you have?  Are there any organizations you get automatic emails from that you don't bother unsubscribing from?  Do you organize your emails in different folders or just let everything sit in your inbox?  Did you ever actually send those old chain emails out to people?

"I hope someone reads this, even if its one person. I want to get some stuff off my chest, it's too much to tell my family so they won't know why I am killing myself I feel like a literal dysfunction of the brain. I've been mentally and physically abused from a very young age until I was 7, although, it still felt like quite a normal life. When my dad left and I was just being raised by my mom it was the best time of my life. As sad as it is, from 7 until 13 was the only time I ever had friends. Actual genuine friends who I had fun with and considered family. During this time though was when one of the contributors to my fucked up brain was coming to fruition. My brother introduced me to porn, when I was very young. He taught me how to masturbate and that evolved into me and him masturbating under his sheets together. Then one day he proposed the idea that we jack each other off while we were taking a bath. (forgot to mention he is 3 years older than me) This caused me to have a fucked up psychological state for a long time. I thought I was gay for a long time even though I knew a hundred percent I was attracted to women. I have fucked up sexual desires due to this. I'm attracted to my fucking cousin. I'm not gonna go into more depth about this because it's too painful being self aware of the fucked up thoughts I have. Anyways, we moved to Jakarta when I was in grade 7, that's when my social life ended. All my traumas came back and I just couldn't socialize. It was terrifying and I ended up becoming addicted to my computer. I had no friends for 2 years and only superficial relationships with other losers. In my freshman year I took some action and went out to parties. Went out a few times drinking until I met some other people that were pretty cool, I still kept up a fake persona so I could not connect with anyone. Drank at least once a week. Then I moved to Kyiv in grade 10, my first school I went to was terrible. All my fault, because I ruined it for myself, I closed myself in with defensive walls, and was an unintentional asshole causing everyone to hate me. I dropped out to do online courses suddenly by just not showing up to school one day. My mom allowed me to do that because she noticed the dire situation I was in. The online courses turned into me spending a whole year in one room without leaving almost ever. I played games and watched movies and youtube videos. I coped with my shitty life by drowning in dopamine giving tools on my laptop. My mom went crazy throughout the year because I was failing the online courses and was just fucking around. In this year I met one guy, I'll call him Owen. Me and Owen weren't really friends. Just two losers who got together because we were rejected by all others. Me and him smoked a lot of weed together. I don't know why I smoked weed because every time I did I became extremely anxious and closed off. He witnessed my mental decline first hand. He definitely noticed I was not okay. We also discovered hard drugs that year. We met some guy that became our drug dealer one night when we were searching for a strip club. One thing led to another and we met some ukrainian pimp who also deals drugs. The first time I asked him if he had ecstasy he said yea, and when we actually got it, it was some paper with a MOUND of white powder. We didn't know it was speed at the time, we had absolutely no idea what we were taking. We didn't snort it, we ate the speed. The night started out, we felt the effects about 20 minutes in. It was crazy. Too fucking crazy. I started talking non stop. I think I was repeating the word fuckin all throughout the night. The most terrifying thing was that we both blacked out for a majority of the night, and my mom was about 10 meters away in her room. He stopped talking, all night he became a mute. I was terrified. I thought he had lost his mind. So I panicked and was trying to get him to say something, literally anything. It was a clusterfuck. We could have easily OD'd that night, the fucking drug dealer was trying to get us hooked so we would be recurring customers. I black out, and then I hear my moms voice at 8am in the morning. As soon as I hear her voice I snap out of the trance. Still fucked, I had to go to the store with her and her friends. We went and as we were going I was trying to keep my cool although still tripping hard. Anyways I did it just fine, my friend stayed at my place and said he saw ghosts. I did this stuff a few more times, it got to the point where I starting picking through the carpet, looking for anything that ever resembles speed to get another hit. I stopped myself before it got too bad. Then we discovered ecstasy. Oooooh man is ecstasy wonderful. It is honestly one of the highlights of my life. Still gonna do it again sometime soon. When we started out we did it too often. Like once or twice a week. I'd be trying to trick my mom into giving me my allowance by changing the progress bar on the website of my online school. It worked a few times. After bingeing a lot we decided to take it easy. We did some research on how to roll safely, and tried. I still pop molly to this day but a lot less frequently. The molly was also pretty bad, it contributed to my intense depression. After a year of absolute hell, I was ready. After only socializing with Owen and my mom for a year I wanted to be better. This time I was gonna be outgoing and have lots of friends. I started school again at the other international school. My first day was cringe but far better because I was optimistic. To give you an idea I introduced myself to a group of guys in my grade, nearly my whole grade, and when they asked where I was from I said, ""I'm white""(I met some other guys that were pretty cool though"". Now we're at the part of the story where I am living now. I've made a decent amount of friends. Still don't consider them close friends. More like school friends. I've blocked myself off with my ""Defensive walls"" again, and this time people don't hate me they are just weirded out by me. Still though, I'm proud of what I've achieved. I get invited to parties, and what not. I still feel empty though. I feel like I want to improve myself but I don't have the energy to do so. Even if I wanted to, I would be working at a lost cause, because I feel that due to my experience my brain is deteriorating and I am incapable of being who I want to be. I'll never become someone I'll be proud of. I'll never be proud of myself. And above all. I am literally unable to have a human connection. I've lost touch with family. Even the mom I live with, I do not connect with her. I've lost 99.9% of my social skills. I am beyond salvageable. I feel like all of that can be fixed by just erasing myself from this world. Death is natural. I do not belong and that's fine with me. My existence will only cause more problems in the future, for my family and for those around me. My children will have my dna, which will leave them handicapped. We are all part of the game of life, natural selection is selecting against me. I guess I am just not meant to be. I am going to kill myself, but I am letting this come to the grave with me. I just needed to tell someone, just needed to get it off my chest so at least one person could see this. I feel like an asshole for killing myself, because I know it will cause immense pain for my mom and my brother (which I do not hold any grudges against despite what he did, he was young stupid and also traumatised), I hope they will understand, and if not I will explain when we meet again where this fucked up life of mine is out of the picture."	sw
"who cares anyways I have no friends and my family doesn't seem to care. I harm myself to make myself feel better, but it's just not enough. I'm constantly spied on by my parents, I have no trust from them even though I've done nothing to make me lose it. I don't leave the house. I'm nearly an adult and yet I'm still treated like a child, though I don't feel as if they care. They know I harm myself, yet nothing is done. Therapy doesn't work. Nothing does.  I don't even know why I'm writing this, I don't know if I'll ever get the guts to end it. Maybe. I'm not sure. I'm just numb. I hate myself. I'm a failure as a child. I don't even see any possibility of it getting better or of me having a decent future. I don't see a point in going on. I just wish someone would care, because I sure don't."	sw
"What would the world be like if speech were purely thought-exchange with no trying to affect outcomes? By ""no trying to affect outcomes"", I mean the only goal of speech would be to express your own thoughts without trying to affect how the other person feels or what kind of benefit you can get from tailoring speech some way.   I think it would be great. Humanity would be way more advanced cause we're focusing on developing and challenging thoughts/ideas rather than playing the same social games over and over. Do you agree?

"Reading through old messenger chat logs with old friends and crushes hits me with such a sad nostalgic feeling I was looking through a couple of my old messenger convo's with people i haven't talked to in years and it's so weird how it's all there,  how one moment you're talking super casually back and forth about some TV show and then suddenly you reach the last message you sent to that person ever.   It seems so wrong that most of the time the last message is some super mundane stuff, ""gotta study, see you tomorrow!""  like that. When i think back to it, i almost feel like i should have written an offical goodbye to close it up better ""I appreciate our friendship and i'am sorry that it has to end"" or something, lol.   You remember so much stuff reading through them as well, it's almost like a diary. Girls i dated or liked hits especially hard,  how you can see the awkward flirting in the beginning and how you grow more confident until you finally ask her out. The loving ""good night"" messages with heart emojis, and then later, the heartbroken hurtful words you send it each other  that now seems so pitty,  but at the time all  you wanted to do was hurt each other..   Drunk messages, plans,  groupchats, exchange of homework, silly youtube videos...it's all still there.

"My favorite game to play on Reddit Whenever I see a picture in r/oldschoolcool of OP’s parents or grandparents and they happen to be attractive, I click on the post and scroll through the comments until I find some variation of “No wonder you were born.” Once I find it, (I always do) I upvote the comment, any other comments that make me laugh, and then the post itself, and continue on my way. That is all.  I love it. It makes me laugh, and it’s oddly satisfying to see. I don’t know why."	cc
"The inevitable truth I am going to end my own life. I don't know when, where, or how. Like many people before I feel as though I will continue to live my life and maybe even be successful, but I will never feel happy again, that was taken from me in some way or another. I am not even sure how it happened. I might do it tonight, I might do it in 34 years. I don't know how long I will last, but I am trying my hardest. I wish I could be strong enough to not feel this way. I wish I could believe others when they tell me positive things. I make myself unattractive, I make myself fail at things. The more effort I put into something, the more disappointed I am with the results. I can't see anything positive in myself, only in others. I feel doomed to commit this attrocity. I need help. I have been reaching out, but nothing seems to make a difference for more than a few minutes at a time, now I spend all my time at the bars whether I am drinking or not. "	sw
"Can’t go on anymore Been depressed / suicidal for a month approximately, during weekdays I managed to stay on work until late, it’s more manageable there. I can distract and kind of feel ashamed to be depressed there, so I have a good reason to look normal.  In relation to this matter, today is being the hardest day of my life. The only things I can think are the things that bring me down. I just want it to end, no matter how. I’m sweating while still and it’s not even hot here.   I bought some razors and I’m planning to use it. Not to kill me, but the physical pain somehow makes me forget my life for a while. I’m too much of a loser to just kill my self. Too afraid of what people will think about me, and sometimes I even feel hope, so this stops me to go on.  Anyway, I don’t know what I expect from writing this, just got the urge. And I fear so much for tomorrow, it’s Sunday and I’ll be home too, from the way things are going it will be even more painful than today.  Just need to end it, by one way or another.  "	sw
"Why am I still here? I have suffered from depression for well over 6 years now. Finally, I felt I was on an upswing.  I was getting somewhere. I felt like I was regaining aspects of control in my life and I was beginning the (gradual) process to reclaiming my mental health and confidence. And then I felt the walls close in. I tried to push against with all the strength I have, but for once I realized I wasn't only fighting my own demons. I am fighting other people. People who are supposed to be my rock, my life support, but instead back me into a dark corner and turn their backs and walk away. As if it were that easy just to leave someone you love behind. These are the same people that call me selfish for wanting to die. But is this really living? Groveling on the floor desperately grasping at any semblance of hope and strength while the person dearest to you, who should love you the most, tramples your reaching hands and steps on your chest while you gasp for air. They scream ""fuck you"" and ""I don't give a shit what the fuck you do"" and ""I hate you."" And my favorite, ""do whatever you want, kill yourself, I'm going to keep screaming fuck you and I hate you until you die so that's your last memory."" Lol. So what am I doing? I have always wanted to die, but I always felt like, what's the harm in living another day? What is the rush to die, if in death nothing means anything anymore, it's not like it would remember the extra memories of pain and betrayal. I would just be nothing. Nothing. That sounds blissful. Life is empty promises and uncertainty. Death is certainty. I know what I will become: nothing. I know what I will feel, nothing.  I'm not in a rush to die, but I know when death it worth infinitely more than the life I am living.   I would love to feel nothing. "	sw
"I Might Be a Kind Weirdo... So, context: I was in the ER tonight with a family member that had breathing problems. We were there a couple hours and in that timeframe, I overheard the person next door (older gentleman) ask his wife if she had any hard candies or anything for him to chew on in her purse... After we were released, I went to the vending machine and grabbed some Breath Savers and some Fruit Snacks, walked back in (there’s a back way to get to the curtain rooms) and handed them over to him, explaining that I’d overheard him asking his wife for something and I know what it’s like to spend hours back there and I wished him and his wife a Happy Easter. They seemed genuinely grateful for the gesture, thanking me profusely and I don’t think it was  “weird” at all-I didn’t get any “Who the hell is this wacky bag?!” Vibes off them... but WAS it weird??

"I like to watch romantic comedies and cry about how happy I am in my relationship. I’m twenty-four and I’ve been in love many times. But not real love. Love that was so obviously one sided. Love that clearly had a finish line. Love that would almost kill me from the fear of being alone.  Not anymore.  After putting one of my best friends in the “friend-zone” for three years, I finally had that moment of “realizing what was right in front of me”.  And now I’m really in love. And it’s finally with someone who is also really in love with me.  I’m an avid movie watcher. Always leaning towards the horror/thriller genre because “the boyfriend always dies”. Despite being in relationships, watching any type of romantic movie stung my heart. I just never felt like I had that and I always yearned for it.  Now my favorite pass time is watching rom-coms, thinking about my boyfriend and our future together. I get so happy, I become so filled with his love even when he’s nowhere around that it brings tears to my eyes.  I don’t know. I don’t really have anyone to talk to this about. All my friends are single and I don’t like to be that bitch of a friend who brags about her perfect love life all the time. I last minute got two days off work whereas my boyfriend is working all day and I’ve been watching romantic movies while he’s away and this just keeps crossing my mind. "	cc

"The validation in having your work as the set example. I love the feeling of when one of my teachers uses my work as the example for the entire class.   Today, my technology teacher had asked to take a photo of my video editing project. He wanted to show off my timeline of all the footage and all the cuts, audio alters and whatnot off to my class. In my technology class, I feel really out of place because everyone there is male and being female I always feel this pressure from them. I know it sounds stupid and cliche, but when he showed everyone my project, everyone awed and gave such an amazed reaction. People were confused on how complex my work was, and how they didn’t understand how I did it. The entire time I felt so good to have my work shown off. He went into detail on what I did, and everyone was amazed at what I had done. It just felt really good. "	cc

"I Brainwash Myself to Believe I Don’t Have Depression (Long Post) I’m a high school student, grade 10 specifically. Mentally, I always believed I was a very healthy person. I lived in a good home and have many friends. Though starting second semester (Feb of this year) I started to go through episodes of “anxiety” and “depression”. This happened because of the amount of work I have to go through and several health problems (Sleep problems, type 1 diabetes). I often feel like a burden to everyone because of how much I make them go through because of my diminishing body and my lack of ability to be logically-mathematically intelligent.    Let me start with what happens at home and how it leads to everything. Like I said before, I live in an amazing home and a loving family. But the problems with them is a lot to do with their background. They’re immigrants and though I’m sure they know of depression, I believe they won’t take me seriously. When they watch the news and a report of a teen committing suicide comes up, they always tell me to talk to them if I ever had the thought. They always try to ask me how my life is going because they want to know I’m not going out of control. When I started to experience a spiral in my emotions, I wanted to approach them, but I always stopped myself. “They’re not from here, they don’t speak perfect English, they can’t comprehend what you’re going through, they’ll just tell you off.” Those are just some of the thoughts I have whenever I think about telling them. Stripping the connection between my episodes and letting them know what’s going on severely influenced me to keep everything under the rug from my family. This made me think this is only my situation and that they shouldn’t know or else I’ll just be told I’m “overthinking.”  Secondly, I’m extremely young. I always tell myself, “you’re in high school, not even a sophomore, and you’re seriously going through this?” I make myself believe that for someone my age, I should focus on doing my homework and having a social life. To add on, people my age (my school specifically) shun those with depression. People at my school make it seem you’re one of those weird kids (the tumblr SJWs) if you come out with depression. As much I say don’t judge people, obviously I still want a reputation of being healthy and caring. I hate myself for that so I bury my emotions in fake smiles towards everyone when I really think of just leaving this place...  Lastly, I brainwashed myself to make my reasons sound stupid. If you read before, I said I have depression because of my inability to keep up academically and disappointing everyone. I also gained it from feeling like a burden to my family (and even doctors) because of my illnesses. I make myself think others always have it worse. “You’re being scolded by your biology teacher because you don’t know how to dihybrid crosses? And you have depression because of that? Seriously?” Is what I’ll say. I just feel like I’m never good enough, I will never be good enough. My family won’t have to waste a dime on me if I’m dead. My doctors won’t have to care if I’m dead. My teachers won’t have to worry about failing a stupid student if I’m dead. My friends won’t hear me complain and annoy them if I’m dead.   TLDR; I need help and I have no idea how to make myself stop thinking the world would be better if I’m not here. I continually say others have it worse and nobody would think it’s a legitimate reason why I should be depressed. I can’t stop saying nobody will understand/care and that I’m just an over-thinker because boys my age should be doing school work and not complain until they get to the real world. "	sw
"I am so over feeling like nothing and always doing something wrong and things going wrong... It seems I just can't get a break: mom and dad passed away in 2014 and 2015, 2016 I broke up with my bf because I got so frustrated with everything him stressing about his work, my brother sueing my sister and I, my parents dying...  At least I was lucky still that he took me back, I love him so much and he's gotten a great job where he's not stressed out anymore...  I had to quit my job because I got promoted and didn't get the option to be back to my lower position (it was less stressful), and now been like 8 months jobless.  2017, my bf's friend passed away from cancer...  2018, finally we could afford a small holiday to another state, we got back, we find out one of our cats almost died from a kidney disease, my last bits of savings to keep him going. He's healthier again and happy, and I'm glad I did it, but damn it, I know I should appreciate what I have, but I hate myself so much lately:  It's hard with my bf who isn't very emotional and we never do things together like watch a movie or anything, we just sit on our computers and talk to each other; I had a talk with him and maybe I got through him finally, but I just wish he would do something out of his way for me since I suprise him with his favourite snacks when he calls and has had a bad day, I listen to him every night complain about work, I cook and clean and I do pay for my own rent and bills since I have savings...  I'm just so tired of crying every night now, I called my bf's mother and wished her a happy Birthday, but they wanted to cut it short and kept asking about what I'm doing with myself...it made me feel baaad.  I've just been feeling like crap, I don't want to call lifeline because with all my problems they tell me to see a psychiatrist, and the last time I saw one he gave me medication that made me too tired. I went back, and he tried to give me even more medication on top of that. I have been functioning without medication for years after all of this crap, I know I need to work on finding a job, I'm not sitting around sleeping or being depressed, but I am so frustrated in not finding any jobs I want.  I just want a normal cashier job where I can scan items, talk to customers and go home. Not sales where I'm pressured to reach targets, not food because people blame you for everything (at least as a cashier you sell it as it is, not actually making the product)...and it seems just too much to ask for nowadays.  Not to mention I'm desperate to get attention all the time lately: I never get compliments from my boyfriend and I give him loads; but I don't know people or have friends that are into the same things as I am. Even with my boyfriend's family I feel like an idiot: His granddad went out driving with me, and I almost hit a gas tank and for that I feel everybody thinks I'm an idiot.  I just don't know why I should continue on: I always try to think it will get better, but then thinks always get even worse and worse...I'm even worried now that something will go wrong with my taxes and what I waste I am, I'm an idiot who can't do anything.  I always wanted to be a graphic designer, I did a bachelor of digital media but only two subjects were about graphic design and it was bullshit to create some kind of art piece, not following a brief whatsoever. I did 2 internships who both said my knowledge was lacking and was mostly changing facebook banners or marketing and I hate it now. Even becoming an illustrator, my art work never sells, it's not good enough no matter how hard I try.   I'm so tired, I just want advice or someone to listen to me without being tired or angry that I'm emotional again (Because I know how annoying it is to hear it all the time, I don't want to burden people I love with it all the time, god knows if my bf still has the strength to want to be with me)."	sw

I have everything for the new plan (plan 1 + a plastic bag) did some research and its not too pleasant either. dying isn't supposed to be pleasant i guess but i wish it would just be like falling asleep. I would just shoot myself but I can't get a gun.  I don't want to find out what happens if I fuck it up. but I can't go on living like this and i really just want to sleep forever. I'm scare of failing and I'm scared of succeeding and of not doing anything and living and I'm scared to Get Help???? fuck   I'm sorry this doesn't make sense does it. First time trying to articulate anything like this. I don't even know whats wrong with me by all measures i should be alive and happy but i really want to be not forced to experience anything if i could just be unaware. I'm so sorry. It really is selfish but i'm not a good person and i don't care how anyone around me ends up feeling as long as I don't have to be there to deal with it. see? im shit. i know people will be sad and itll tear a massive hole in the lives of my close friends + family but it doesn't matter if i dont have to experience it. problem is, all these shit suicide methods i keep coming up with probably will make me experience it! maybe even with brain damage!   I'm around people and sometimes I'm so tense and terrified and i can't even choke a word out to my friends (who are genuinely good people. except for like one of them) and it's just so obvious that im tense and freaking out and every single noise and pair of eyes is just tearing chunks out of me and i'm terrified and I don't know why! its all normal really theres nothing out of place. gotta rehearse every single word i say and can't open my mouth without breaking a sweat. Sometimes i don't and just go with it and i say stupid stupid nonsensical things or sometimes just straight up lies and i dont know why and people just look at me and try to gloss over it.    I don't know. It feels like I'm ready to kill myself. I've been falling apart for 3 years or so, its gotten better at times but always downhill.  my life isnt going anywhere, i need to just end it.

"A friend told me I feel never feel any remorse today Today a very close friend made an observation that I trend heavily towards being very cold and unforgiving, and I’m kind of having a hard time grappling with it.   I am a very kind person; never vengeful and never purposely offensive to anyone. I’m always polite and I think empathy is a strong suit for me. So you can imagine my disdain when, after an uncharacteristic poorly timed joke from me and subsequent apology, my friend told me that he thinks I’ve never truly felt remorse for anything.   I’ve been thinking about it all day and I think maybe he’s right. I used to be incredibly depressed in high school and since being in college I’ve been doing much better, but with an apparent side effect of being too clinical, apparently to a fault. I feel almost no feelings, good or bad. When I get rejected by women I’m interested in, I feel nothing. I don’t miss anyone, and I don’t feel affection for anyone.   I could pack up and leave tomorrow and never think about my friends twice, just as I did with my high school friends when I left high school.   Do any of you feel this? Am I insane? What’s wrong with me? "	cc

"I've become bored with my own pain I've been severely depressed since I was about 11. I remember being a really happy younger child with lots of friends, and then I started being the target of a lot of bullying from peers as well as from one particular family member who had a lot of control over my immediate family (she owned ""our"" house and frequently invoked her ownership when I or my parents were not ""acting right""). At the same time, my dad kind of lost interest in being involved in my life at all. I'm guessing that combination of things is what started the depression, but it morphed into something else entirely after a while. I  no longer really know how to interact with people and I feel sort of like a nonperson, like I have no real personality or self. I feel like I've tried on different things, but none of them fit. I used to talk to my few loved ones about how I feel, but I've found that people get very tired of hearing it and that it in fact really hurts other people to hear it, so I try not to overshare. I'm tired of hearing it, too. I'm like everyone else who has had over two decades of this feeling under his or her belt. I'm tired of it all. I'm tired of struggling, of rallying and getting knocked back down. I'm in therapy and I've tried many many medications. I have small stretches of improvement. But the depression is still unrelenting, and as I'm beginning to no longer be a young person, I'm thinking more and more that maybe it makes sense to commit suicide. Maybe this isn't going to improve if it hasn't in over 20 years. I can't imagine being able to tolerate it much longer."	sw
"Love of my life left me. Why? I honestly don't want to think about suicide. I know it doesn't fix anything and will only bring harm to my family. I write here not because I want to suicide but because I believe there are some good people out there who will just listen to what I say and help me think about my future. Maybe my problem is nothing compared to the awful experiences other people had but that is just what makes me want to die. I'm sorry if I sound like a kid or somehow hurt others just by saying that. I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to ask for help.  I have a girlfriend. I mean not just a girlfriend to me, we've been together for almost 4 years now. We met in college, spent almost every minute together. I mean it. We lived in dorms together, took same classes, we both weren't very social so literally almost every single minute passed together. We were really happy, our parents met, we were serious. Then we graduated and started working. We only saw each other once a week for few hours. We both live with our parent and very far from each other. Today, out of nowhere she told me she wants to have a break, that she is so unhappy but she is not sure whether this unhappiness is because of me or not. She said to me she cries in mornings because she is unhappy and she didn't tell me. We never lied to each other or hid something except this. I'm shocked. I mean this mind sound stupid but I felt like we were one. She is my greatest friend, my only true friend, she was like me. I could talk literally anything with her without hesitation. She was the same. I know.   Now she wants a break. She says she needs to think whether she is unhappy because of me or not. I don't even get it. I ask you, whoever cares,   Is there any possibility someone who is that close to me, like my mother, to just say I need a break, let's not meet for a time, which I cannot give you a precise one?   I can't stop thinking but I just don't see the possibility. No matter what happened in my life, whether the cause is her or not I would have never left her because I know she is worth going through hell. I would never guess something like this would happen because I thought she was like me. We were one and even if life was shit, we would get over it together. I'm not the greatest guy, I know that but I feel like I don't deserve this either. I'm 23(2 days ago was my birthday), but I am pretty sure there will never be someone like her in my life if I ever lose her. I have lived my whole life with only one purpose which is to live with the people you love together to the end of your time. I cared only about love. Why would she even leave me? I seriously do not get it. Someone, please give me an idea why she might have done that.   "	sw
"Dealing with daily thoughts  I'll be finishing College soon and starting a job, but lately, the last few months or so, I've had suicidal thoughts daily. I'm just curious to hear about others and how they're dealing with their thoughts. Most days if I just leave my apartment and try to walk or just distract myself that helps. I don't have any sort of active plan to take my life, so at this point I'm not really interested in doing therapy. I kind of just want to see how I feel after I graduate to decide any sort of plan of action. I've done talk counseling before and it did help and gave me some strategies to deal with anxieties, but the underlying depression has always been there. Basically I'm just trying to see what other people's motivations or grounders to their life. I don't want to die I just don't want to feel like this anymore"	sw

"It's 1am, I'm a little buzzed And I wanna say hey to you all :)   What's the good things you're focusing on atm? For me it's work - I'm finally in a job I like and it's furthering my career.  What you people thankful for? Remember the little things :) "	cc
"Scared I am terrified to take this final step, what if it's agony, or worse doesn't work?  Is there a quick, easy and painless way? "	sw
I can't fucking believe I pussied out After about 40 days of pure pain I decided I was going to kill myself. This was about two weeks ago. I can't believe I pussied out. I want to die so bad. Why couldn't I fucking do it? I don't have anything or anyone to live for. I just drift threw life. Nothing interests me. I get maybe half an hour of sleep a night from the pain. I just honestly can't fucking believe myself. I think I actually will this weekend. I just can't believe I didn't earlier.	sw
"So i just rescued a cat... I run a small cleaning company. I had a call this afternoon from a panicked lady (not a client, just a random) saying she needed someone with a long ladder to rescue her cat that's been on a roof for 12hrs and now seems to be unconscious. I went to have a look but the cat was far too high up for the standard ladders we carry. So I returned to base, got a longer ladder, a roof ladder, and got into my fall arrest harness and went back. Getting up on the roof scared the life outta me. Despite the fact part of our services involve working at height, I still don't like heights!  When I eventually reached the ridgeline where the cat was, it came to and ran down the other side of the roof and then two houses over. I then had to come back down again (anyone else find it scarier coming down from a height than going up it or just me?), go to the back of the house where it was, climb onto a lower roof and eventually managed to coax it down.  Not the day I was expecting when I went to work this morning!  Anyone had something unexpected happen this week?"	cc
"For better or for worse, my computer is my life. At this point my entire life revolves around the computer. Everything seems to just be cheaper and easier to do on a computer than IRL. Doing research, paying bills, finding recipes, shopping, entertaining, socializing, the list just goes on and on. When I consider hobbies that may be of interest like becoming a pilot or racing cars, I end up turning to simulators because they are way cheaper, more convenient, and eliminate the risk of injury.  Do you guys feel like computers taking over your lives as well? I don't think I necessarily view this as being a negative thing, it's just... strange sometimes. And my eyes get tired."	cc
"I just checked into a mental institution. No, someone saw my reddit post about committing suicide and decided to call the mental health clinic. Someone I know, who I deem as a good friend of mine. There are people out there who care for you, and seeing a psychiatrist will help your well-being. Good luck boys. "	sw
"Less people care what you do than you think! I recently finished a presentation workshop with some colleagues to improve our skills. It was a really enjoyable time and safe zone for critique. The one epiphany I had by the end of it, is how little many of us care when someone messes up. We all have insecurities or things going on daily that whatever mistakes we do will occupy seconds of people’s memories. If you think an embarrassing gaffe is bad, remember that it means nothing to those involved with how much is already occupying their lives.  I was extremely nervous going into surgery earlier this year but when it was over I never took the time to think about it. Recently I wanted to make a mental list of things to be proud of myself for and looking back I am proud that I stayed calm and in control.    TL;DR: Don’t brush over the big or small accomplishments done every day, remember people don’t really care about your gaffes like you think.   What are some proud moments of your day?"	cc
"I'm still alive You probably don't know and probably don't care, but i talked about running away and killing myself, it didn't work and I got caught skipping school by my friends dad. It was a very depressing day. Anxiety, anger, and depression is all still as bad, if not, definitely worse. Oh well. Just though I had to update for the couple of people that cares enough to respond "	sw

"I want to quit vaping, but it's so hard! I had my first cigarette when I was 14. I didn't get hooked because me and my friends didn't even know how to smoke properly so we didn't inhale the smoke. Flash forward 4 years, I went to college. The moment my parents left I went out and bought a pack. I started doing it the right way. I inhaled the smoke and it felt so good. I smoked about a pack a day for 5 years and I switched to vaping.  This was a lot better. It tasted better and it didn't stink. I replaced cigarettes with my e cigarette. I don't smoke anymore, but I vape so much. Of course my e-liquid has nicotine. If I go more than 2 hours without it I feel really bad. I get frustrated and it is all I can think. I think it's time to stop, but man this is hard. "	cc
"I woke up this morning and just started crying. Not the kind of casual crying that I do a lot where there are silent tears that start and stop on and off for a few hours. The loud, painful sobs where it's hard to breathe because everything is too much.   Nothing even happened to cause this. I just woke up. And suddenly I just felt the crushing pain of having to be alive, to exist, to be awake and conscious of my loneliness and worthlessness. I feel sick to my stomach.   I just want to die so badly. All of the little things that have kept me alive thus far are either evidently impossible or else people who clearly don't care about me. My plan is to try to make it until the end of the year to see if I can get anything to change but I'm starting to feel I won't even be able to make it until then.   I knew this week long break where I would be sitting around and doing nothing would be awful, but it's somehow even worse than I thought it would be. I just needed to vent I guess. "	sw
"My cat let me clip all his front claws for the first time!! I just wanted to brag somewhere because it's 1 am where I live. He's a former feral who has been living with me for a year. He's my buddy and I'm so proud of the progress he's been making. Heck, the first hour he was home, he bit me so hard I almost needed stitches.  The shelter I got him from never expected him to get adopted. He was angry, miserable, and sad. He normally makes anyone who touches his paws bleed- until tonight!! He wasn't even agitated. He was so calm! He even groomed me back!!   I'm about to go workout for a little bit but I'll keep checking back!   EDIT: https://imgur.com/bR4nGID here he is! "	cc
"Hobbies/lifestyles centered around laidback, outdoor, relatively social environments? Hi all. I grew up with a mom who had a lifestyle similar to the one mentioned above. After work, you could find her sitting on our couch in the garage listening to music, smoking/drinking, and chatting with our neighbors who came over daily. On the weekends you could find her throwing a laidback and informal barbeque or hanging out at the lake again with music and a small group of friends/family. The older I get, the more I long for the kind of life I saw her living. I've been waiting to find more friends in order to experience this but I'm realizing that in order to find friends who enjoy the same kind of lifestyle in the first place, I probably need to have that lifestyle on my own first. Problem is, I have no idea what this ""lifestyle"" even is or how to define it.  I'm hoping someone here can break this down for me a bit. Possibly explain what sort of ""hobbies"" these are and other examples of ones similar so I can start living the life I've been longing to.  **TL;DR** What hobby/lifestyle explains the following activities, and how can I start doing these things in my life more without really having any friends: camping, bonfires, hanging out at the lake with friends, going to festivals, having laidback BBQs, etc.  Hope this makes sense! I know it's a bit vague."	cc
Almost Last night I stood at our kitchen and held a chef knife towards my stomach. Right before I thrusted it into my intestines for some reason I stopped myself. I was having a psychotic episode all by myself. Now all I feel is guilt and anger. Guilt for pushing my pain on others and anger for not going through with it. I can't stop thinking about it. I feel like I'm going to end it tomorrow night after school. I don't want to tell anyone because I don't want to go to the psych ward again. I also don't want to anger my parents. I don't know what to do...	sw
"Anyone here that got rid of suicidal thoughts? I want to preface this by saying that I hate to create any drama. I want to make it clear that I've got no plans on actually committing suicide, since I could never put that burden of sorrow on my dear family (and I'm of course scared of dying.)  However, I can't get rid of the thoughts of really, really wanting to die. The times I've actually ingested too much of some substance (by accident) and feeling like I was about to die I was very scared, and wanted nothing more than to live. But in my day to day life, I think about suicide very frequently. Once again I wouldn't do it, but the thoughts are very tempting.   I'd just like to hear from someone who used to be suicidal, but isn't anymore, and how you overcame it. I personally don't think, once the thought is there, that it is possible to remove it. I would be very happy to be proved otherwise though, as I'm not here to argue but maybe get some new perspective on things.  Thank you in advance."	sw

"My hubris, laziness and envy cost me everything. February 17th was the best day of my life and one I won't forget.  At eighteen years old, I can count the amount of notable life experiences I've had on the hand of a knife juggler with cerebral palsy, besides two brief trips to Chicago and D.C. I spent most of my life as a recluse; I only ever went to a single friend's house, across the street, when I was very young, before he moved away. My parents, my dad and my brother when he was younger especially were very candid in babying me and treating me as borderline mentally disabled, because I was clumsy and had a severe speech impediment. They neglected to teach me things and admonished me when I couldn't do them. I live in fucking Florida and I don't know how to swim or ride a bike. I have no notable memories of childhood.  One incident that comes to mind was one of my reading classes in elementary school. Everyone gleefully went off to describe their fun times except for me. My secluded development meant I had no real stories to tell. So instead I relayed a tale of me heroically winning a victory against tanks in the demo of a old game called R.U.S.E. I was funny and charismatic enough (either my speech impediment wasn't as pronounced back then or kids and teachers in elementary school really didn't give that much of a damn if a kid talked funny) that nobody really noticed that I was the only one with a essentially fictional story.   Another time I made a mistake and colored outside the lines with a washable marker. Five year old OP shrugged and since it said 'washable' went to the class sink, put it on full blast and then cried when it tore a hole straight through the paper. This story doesn't have much relevance, but I just remembered it as I was typing the last part and thought it would be funny to share.  While I don't view myself as unattractive, I had a very difficult time integrating socially due to my stammer and stutter. Many jokes were left unsaid, and I embraced video games, roleplays and other virtual distractions as escapism. I frequently procrastinated at school (my grades dropped severely as I made the transition from elementary school to middle school) and my schedule was often school, home, video games, repeat ad infinitium. I became self loathing early on, especially as I began to view myself as becoming 'behind in life' compared to others. The only thing I was good at was writing. My junior year was especially rough and I was sorely tempted to commit suicide, had my chronically sick father not pawned off his gun.   Then I met her. Let's call her Mandy.  I met Mandy on a roleplaying site. There was an age gap, an difference in lifestyles, but we hit it off quickly. She said she couldn't tell I had a speech impediment and so, we spent a lot of time talking. She had lovers, FWBs to which I gritted my teeth and bore it. After all, I was lucky to have such a wonderful person as my friend, I wouldn't dare ask for more. But there was *something.* Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, does true love exist? I don't fucking know, I'm just a depressed kid on the internet.  But this depressed internet kid, with virtually no significant events in his life could talk to Mandy on call for seven hours at a time, practically continuously. We literally once talked from sunset to sunrise, until we both fell asleep. We occasionally said the same thing as each other at the same time in our roleplay chats and I even once casually predicted the exact time she would wake up to the very minute.   I was slightly smitten.  I felt a little more confident. My English Teacher, who I share a strong bond with ran the school team for a county contest analogous to jeopardy. I had never went to a single extracurricular activity before hand, but I decided to participate to her delight. It was being held at a local college, on February 17th.   My literature and history skills finally came in handy for something other than internet debate and our school team went from the lowest scoring team to the top of the bracket. A real underdog story.   We went out to get ice cream afterwards. My teacher and I talked, and I tormented her with my satirical conservative proclamations (I once called her vegan beef 'CNN' meat, since they were both fake) which never failed to elicit laughter from her. I had a good time.  Mandy texted me. Though we've been prodding at feelings for each other for awhile, it culminated in mutual declarations of love. She told me, despite the reservations of her hungover brain, how she fell more and more in love with me the more we talked. It was a sensation of utter bliss. How she didn't care about the age gap anymore. If it sounds like bullshit, then I don't blame you. I could hardly believe it myself. It was everything a love-struck little nerd like myself could dream of and more.  I went out to eat with my family later that night as well. Maybe it was with the confidence I now carried or the manner in which I whipped out my wallet, but they seemed to finally recognize me as an adult. My sister even said as much.   Life seemed beautiful. I had hope for the first time in a long time that everything would turn out okay.  Me and Mandy were disgustingly in love. She offered to drop her FWB when she saw how I felt and we became exclusive. Of course, we never formally dated because e-dating was a thing only stupid people did. We had a grand plan, though. A book.   It initially began as a generic, sappy love story meant to be hurled onto Amazon for a few quick books. But we had genuinely good ideas over our brainstorming sessions, which quickly evolved into a truly interesting book. I was the writer and she was the editor. We were going to be a cute writer couple, with our names together on bookshelves, and after that, how could we not be together? I wasn't good at much, but I envisioned living together with her, learning basic mechanical skills from her handy father, learning to draw better, everything.  But I became complacent, lazy. She pleaded with me to write more, we weren't going nearly as fast as we hoped. 'I want to be with you *now*' she said. And you know what I fucking did? I played video games. I had writer's block, I had difficulty getting the words out. So instead of putting forth more effort, I delved back into escapism. There were inbred sons to disinherit in Crusader Kings, cavalry charges to be executed in Mount and Blade and an oppressed earth to be liberated in X-Com.   Tensions grew. Where we once thought we could resolve any dispute through talking, we began to fight more and more often. She discussed one of her ex-FWBs being a nuisance in his messaging. I dismissed it, for I was still a little envious. And that was it. The straw that broke the camel's back. She left.   Things started to fall apart for me. My constant procrastination in school caught up with me. I was on the borderline of failing and my disappointed family quickly demoted me back to infanthood. I had drifted away with some of my friends, both real life and online, and one of my closest simply left entirely as well. I had only my English Teacher, who I fear I will not see after I graduate.   In the span of two months, I've fully regressed back to the hellish junior year and lost everything.   I haven't touched my console in ages and I've deleted all my games from my computer. I don't consume any media, I put reddit on a ten minute timer a day timer that locks me out afterwards which I only violate for this post. I don't watch television, I don't watch movies. I quit sugary drinks and junkfood. I don't even jack off anymore. I even intermittently fast, only for a day at time as my father would become suspicious if I missed anymore meals than that. I deny myself everything. I now spend my days pacing, writing, walking in the park, reading Nabakov and other authors and sleeping.   But it's too late. I lost it all and now I'm seriously considering ending it. I don't have a gun in reach, but I'm waiting to save up a little bit of money for another way. "	sw

Does anyone give themselves a deadline? There came a point in my life when I gave myself one year to live but I calmed down. Lately I've been getting these suicidal thoughts  again. The problem is I'm Christian now and that goes against my faith. Sometimes I question my faith as I've only recanted converted. I can't fight off these suicidal thoughts. If I have say less than one year to life I just don't feel as much pressure. As it is it's a combination of logic and emotions that have driven me to this point. I can't say I can think of a better reason to end my life than the simple fact that I can't escape myself.	sw
"How did you meet the love of your life and when did you know? My favorite question(s) to ask people has/have always been “how did you meet your significant other” and “what was your first date”. I love hearing the answers and even the simple things turn romantic when you know the couple has been together for years. For example; my parents first date was at TacoBell and they were set up by my moms best friend that happened to work with my dad. My grandparents on one side had their first date at a restaurant in town where my grandmother ate pizza for the first time in her life (she’d never heard of it until that date and was mad my grandpa only ordered “something for him, I was hungry too”). My other grandparents used to ride the bus to school together every day from kindergarten through high school. So please, tell me your stories! "	cc
"I just needed to talk about this. I'm in my second semester of college right now and things aren't exactly going my way. I barely made it out of a pretty depressing first semester. I'm in a STEM major and I enrolled in ROTC last semester because it's been my dream for the longest time to go to space one day, but I'd settle for being a pilot, too. Anyway, in my first semester, I was depressed because the shift in difficulty of academics was incredibly jarring to me, and I had trouble making friends, which made me think something was wrong with me. I was failing a math class, and ROTC was inherently stressful, and I just felt alone, ashamed, and just shitty a lot of the time. But I just barely passed the math class and I made a lot of friends. Second semester rolls around, and things are starting to look up. I finally feel comfortable in ROTC, I get a 92 on my first chem exam. There are still things I'm sad about, but I'll talk about that later. Anyway, I'm feeling generally happy about the semester so far. Then I get a 52 on my first math exam. I dug myself into this hole again. That's okay though, I'll just do better on the next one and the final. My academic performance starts slipping across the board, but I'm only in trouble in my math class. Fast forward about a month or so. I'm told that I don't medically qualify for ROTC because I was on ADHD medication 2 years ago. This is devastating to me. I was finally feeling comfortable, I had finally made friends, and I thought ADHD wasn't going to be an obstacle for me anymore. I had never identified with a certain group or felt like I was a part of something worth being a part of before, so to have that dangled in front of my face and then ripped away felt horrible. It's okay though, it's not the end of world because I'm still eligible to apply for Officer Training School after I graduate. Two days later, I meet with cadre. They review my case and tell me that because of a certain skin condition, I don't medically qualify for military service. Which means I can't be a pilot. I went back to my dorm, and for the first time in my life, I seriously considered suicide. It felt like I was in a nightmare. Like I was presented with a puzzle that I couldn't solve. I wanted to hurt someone, or myself. I didn't do anything, though; I didn't really know what to do. A week later I take my second math exam of the semester. A week from that, I find out I failed, and I'll have to drop the class. I studied really hard and I thought I got at least an 80. It's incredibly frustrating to go from high school, where I never studied for anything and almost never got below an 80 on a test or quiz, where I was good at math and science and academics in general, to college, where I can actually study for quizzes and exams and almost never get above an 80. It's even more frustrating when my friends and people on my floor talk about how they got Bs and As on the same exams I took. I'm running out of ways to convince myself I'm not a fucking moron. I just feel like such a fraud, in more ways than one. I've also never had a girlfriend, so that's always a reason for me to feel like a waste of skin. I've never experienced mutual romantic love. I have friends, yeah, but they don't need me. I've always had a problem with comparing myself to other people, and that's all I've been doing recently, and I just start to feel awful if I'm alone with my thoughts for too long. I feel like I have nothing to be proud of anymore.  Sorry for making this really long, I've never talked about most of this stuff with anyone and my friends and family aren't very good at comforting. I'm pretty sure nobody knows I'm unhappy, and I'm too afraid to change that. I just need to talk to someone."	sw

"There's no greater smell than that of Spring. Hey, Reddit, hope you're all doing well. I'm just sitting here in bed with my window open a crack for the first time since last Fall. It's still relatively cold where I live, but I just realized - like I do every year - how much I missed the smell of Spring.  I can't really explain it; perhaps dirty, musty, metallic a bit? I'm sure there's some scientific explanation behind it (organic chemistry that leads to certain smells). Whatever it is, it smells so nice that I wish I could bottle it up and wear it as a perfume.  It's the kind of smell that rekindles a bit of hope in me. A sense of, ""Thank god winter's over!"", and the feeling of good things to come.  Am I weird for thinking there's a distinct ""scent"" to seasons, or have you noticed the same thing? What do the different seasons smell like to you? How do they make you feel?"	cc
"I've given up I have suffered from depression for a long enough time now to have completely given up. I'm only 16 and I feel like my life is already doomed to fail. I'm not even able to try anymore, my body has just given up.   School is impossible for me, even the smallest tests and school days stress me out to the point of being sick or crying. I go to a therapist and I've tried medications, but nothing works. The medication has even made it worse for me at this point. (I have stopped taking the meds, since me, my parents and the therapist agreed that it was making me worse)  I've ""quit"" school like 3 or 4 times and just sat at home staring at nothing the entire day for 4 weeks in a row. I don't know what it's called in English (I'm norwegian), but i was once held in a place since I didn't go to school for like 4 weeks. It completely fucked me up and i now basically have some sort of ptsd (self diagnosed, so it's probably complete bullshit) thing or whatever. I basically just get horrified to the point of freaking out completely and just losing all control of myself when a person that could make me go back tells me that i might have to. I currently go to a school that's supposed to have a lot less tests, but I'm not able to focus so it doesn't help.   I don't want to kill myself, because i have friends, i have family. I have all these things that should make me happy, but since I just don't function that well (My entire body hurts all the time) I am 99% sure I'm never going to be able to get a job or anything like that in the future. Even the smallest tasks like making some simple food, that requires an oven or something like that stresses me out enough to make me cry.  I know that I'm young and ""i have my whole life ahead of me"" and all that garbage, but I really just feel like that i won't be able to work or anything because everything just stresses me out so much.   I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't even know why I'm posting this as I can't help myself, so why would anyone be able to help me?"	sw
"I had suppressed the part that made this suicide sound so rational but now it's back It just makes sense.

Could i have a fullfilling life, find a job, get a wife and some kids and a dog and a house? Sure but I don't want any of that, why work hard to get it? And the alternative is to wither away alone?

"I’m starting to lose my mind. I’ve been suicidal for a while now, I had an intervention type thing with my family and it was kinda eye opening. But recently I’ve been spiraling down this dark path where I’ve been getting really upset, thinking about regrets, I had a ex gf who I blew off for a couple months and I finally decided to try to get back with her and it didn’t work out she didn’t want me and I just can’t take it anymore.

"Apparently I've done nothing right in my life I've worked hard, tried to help others, given of myself wholeheartedly, struggled with my demons, struggled against injustice, tried to reach outside my comfort zone, sought help, been medicated...all of it. Yet here I am alone and unloved, not even family by my side, and constantly on the verge of tears I have to hide from the world. People say have hope and love will find you, but it hasn't, nothing has. I am nothing. At his point I don't feel I have the energy to do anymore...to try to meet people, to live healthy, to work hard. I've done all that and it has got me nothing; I feel like I'm cursed and I have no energy to do anymore. What's the point? If I die today it's like nothing I ever did mattered, nothing was ever right. *I* have never been right. Maybe I'm not meant for this world.  I'm so tired i'm done."	sw

For a bit of context, Ive gotten into exercising semi-reguarly half a year ago and went from a twig to a small branch and I tried to get my to join me to help her lose weight.

I currently work at a 5* hotel and the job sucks ass but i do my best at it and i have not experienced any guest complaints for the most part ( forgot the coffee in one room). One of the perks however of the shitty job though is I get a gianormous discount at other locations of the hotel. Well now I am at one of those chains and today guess what happened here.... They didn't refill our coffee station. Which i can understand seeing as how that happened to me. What i can't understand is that they removed all the cups from the room and didn't refill the water station and when i called about the cups and water they said they would charge for the water and the woman who picked up the phone was kind of unpleasant when talking to me. Now i feel as though this is not right as at my place of work the staff, including me, are always polite and welcoming to the guests. I am considering complaining but i don't want to get anyone in trouble with their supervisor. Am I being unreasonable or am i justified?

I binge drink about once a week and every time I do, I take it too far and cause damage to myself and everyone around me. my family and friends are so disappointed in me, and I am too. I don’t know who I am when I look in the mirror. I go through life in a fog, nothing feels real and everything seems so pointless and it’s been this way since I was about 12. I attempted suicide twice when I was 13. I went to the psych ward and they didn’t help me at all. They didn’t care. I didn’t see one single therapist while I was there, just a doctor who kept asking me the same painful questions and was very rude. I can’t keep a job because my anxiety hinders me from going out into the real world and being normal. I’m toxic. I neglect myself and the people I love. I’m selfish and a liar and I don’t know who I am anymore. I just want to go to sleep and not wake up and finally be at peace. I feel like I’m drowning every single day and I can’t stop being toxic. I want to try to change so bad but every time I try i get knocked down even harder and I feel so weak. I can’t bring myself to even do the fucking dishes. I used to take care of myself but I have gained 50 pounds and I have worn sweatpants and baggy t shirts for two years. My boyfriend hates that I can’t take care of myself and he is tired of taking care of me. I don’t blame him. I’ve pushed everyone out of my life. My friends and family are tired of me fucking up.

My last suicide attempt was in January and I hung myself but unfortunately I survived. I see a therapist and psychiatrist but nothing seems to get better. I was molested as a child for a couple of years by my brother, sexually assaulted for a year by someone who claimed to be a friend, and I was raped in January by someone I liked. I was also beat up as a kid not only by peers but also my family.  I’m diagnosed bipolar with ptsd and anxiety, before my bipolar diagnosis I had major depressive disorder. I also have schizophrenic tendencies.My therapist suspects I have body dysmorphia as well. I’m rapidly losing friends and constantly getting in arguments with family.  I feel like I have nothing to live for. The happiest I’ve been was actually in an emotionally abusive relationship that I kept up with for over a year. I’m still not over him unfortunately. I just don’t know why I’m still here. I’ve come so close to death. So many people dismiss me because I get good grades and my life on the outside seems great because I appear so happy. Sometimes I want to die just so I can make others feel bad for putting me down. I wish I wasn’t here anymore. Life never seems to get any better, I’m always under constant pain"	sw

"I don't know what to do My wife and I have both been severely depressed, to the point of suicidality. I'm 29, she's 26. I learned about two years ago that I am transgender. So I feel like I have found a way to ""cure"" my depression, but my cure is to transition and it is making her more depressed.  I haven't started any medical transition yet, but I have been transitioning socially for about 8 months. And my depression is lower and less frequent now than it has been in years, I feel like I really am doing the right thing for my own mental health.  My wife tries to be supportive. She uses my preferred pronouns and outwardly supports me, but it's killing her inside. She won't talk to me about it because she says I'm too sensitive and defensive about it. She has also said that I'm becoming narcissistic, and I can see what she means. I recognize the behaviors in myself and I'm trying not to be, but I think it stems from my trying to fight the shame of being trans that I've felt most of my life. My wife is openly bisexual (she came out right after I came out as trans) but she has never had a relationship with a woman. She has also been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, which makes her very hard on herself and gives her severe social anxiety. So she has nobody to talk to because she has no friends and isn't very close to her family. She's a very intelligent person, she just got her Masters degree and is going to get a PhD.  She also told me this morning that people with BPD have around an 80% suicide attempt rate. And that it is basically on her mind all the time.  I really really don't know what to do. I've found a treatment for my depression, but it's making her's worse. We've been married about 5 years and have talked about getting a divorce multiple times. But I'm afraid that if we ever actually did, the rejection would literally kill her. Or if not it would traumatize her so severely she wouldn't be able to recover from it.  I'm going to cross post this because I really need some help. Please."	sw

Like the world has left me behind. I barely know what's going on around me and have an extremely hard time following conversations. I hunger for social interaction but have lost the limited social skillset I had. I'm afraid of nearly everyone and I feel coldness and hostility from people. I'm living in my own head nearly constantly.  Every day I'm on the edge. I have no more tricks or tactics to hide myself from myself.  The booze stopped working along with everything else.  I've created this situation myself through the years. But even if I deserve this it doesn't mean I can accept it.  I think to myself what would happen if I won 10 million dollars.

"I’m loving life right now, are you guys? Last year I had a terrible year, finally got over so drug related issues and managed to repair the extremely damaged relationship with my girlfriend. Lived on a minimal budget and managed to save over a grand in my final year at uni. Then went for a eye opening holiday in Taiwan. We did this thing that is meant to bring good luck for the following year, so we went round this temple in a certain direction and it’s honestly like everything has gone well since then. I passed my driving test after three weeks of lesson. I missed out on a job offer for not having a driving licence but then I received a better offer at an amazing firm. Honestly work has been going amazingly and my girlfriend and I have never been better. It just seems like finally after a long period of shit years and so much drama life has just sorted itself out in a matter of months. Just thought I would share because I feel so lucky and happy that all my effort is finally paying back dividends and making my life so much better. I still have debt and I still have a long way to go till I’m back on track however, my debts are being paid off rapidly. Over a grand in three months while meeting minimal payments on the rest.

"Not acutely suicidal, but noncommittal and detached about living or dying. I'm 25/male. This is a bit of a ramble so apologies in advanced.   I've attempted several times, especially during my first and only semester at university. Since my early 20's though I've just been 'meh', Taking a detached feeling towards life.   I've never held a steady job, I'm legally unable to drive due to vision issues. I have many 'minor' disabilities, and I'm very overweight, I can't recall ever being at a normal weight at any age.   I guess part of my problem is that I judge myself before I let others judge me. I've always felt self conscious since I was in elementary school, that I have this awkward aura, or that people tend to overestimate my disabilities. I've always hated thinking of myself as 'disabled' since I'm not that disabled. The resources I'm eligible for should go to someone that needs it more.  Another thing I'm self conscious of as of late is how much I might be like my father (In prison since I was 8 for violent crimes I won't go into,) especially as my temper seems to be getting shorter the more I realize just how much of a general failure I am. I didn't have the best start, and I've made some shit decisions. I was a horrible person when I was a teenager.  Often I'm asking myself if I'm a decent person that's made mistakes, or if I'm a sociopath with a conscience, or something resembling a conscience.   I don't see the selfishness argument as one that often works, but I feel like I'm just here until my family ties all but disappear. I have a hard time seeing myself marrying or starting a family, let alone reaching old age.   Part of me just wants to go several thousand miles from here and do something new, though lack of driving ability, a degree in which to secure job opportunities abroad, and being broke in general seems to put a grinding halt on that.   So I'm at a point where there's nothing really stopping me from suicide except for the idea of who it effects. I've got my whole life to make it as 'clean' as possible. "	sw
"Feels like I'm losing my mind Some time around december, I started getting depressed. I was doing super well in life, and then suddenly my progress paused and I just sort of fell into this. I started feeling sad, anxious, the whole works. Then my life started back up again, and great things happened in my life, but I'm only getting more anxious and depressed as it happens and that's affecting what's happening in my life. I got accepted into a prestigious and exclusive improv comedy group, but as I feel like I'm spiralling out of control, I can't perform anymore and I feel like I'm a burden and the group regrets accepting me. My schoolwork is getting affected and my grades are dropping because my mind is always elsewhere. Worst of all, I just can't seem to talk to people anymore and I feel like all the people/friends I have, new and old, see me as some sort of freak right now because I'm really struggling to talk and be social. My mind is just constantly racing and miserable, and I don't know how to fix it. I don't think I could ever commit suicide, but I certainly have started thinking about it a decent amount and that scares me, because I don't want to think about it, and I'm afraid I might actually consider it if my life continues in its current direction. I just needed to get this off my chest. Thanks"	sw

I have low self esteem and low confidence from my childhood and no matter how many times i build my confidence and self esteem, she always break me down and pushes me to depression again. I am always trying to be optimistic but most of the time it's not working. I have no fear of public speaking before but i feel too insecure now a days and i am scared to even go out of my house. I have a habit of comparing myself to others i don't know how to stop it.   I am a very average student in education.when i finished my higher education(i was so naive and stupid), i wanted to take nutrition and dietitics course but she blacked mailed me and made me choose biotechnology and now i can't even shift my career. It really makes me feel low. Recently i failed in my entrance for post graduation(believe me she always don't let me study in home, she always disturbs me and makes sure i am not studying) and made some mistakes in joining another college, so i took a year break. I got hypothyroidism(i got it because of my excessive stress and depression) (i always study while she is sleeping at night)  which made me gain some weight and she calls me fat now and seborrhic dermatitis because of this my hair looks bad and she mocks me for that too. But when i confront her saying this, she tells me she loves me(does she really love me?).  I don't have any friends too and i have serious trust issues because of my childhood sexual abuse by a person i called brother near my house. I overcame depression caused by that by alone but now a days it's so hard and i feel too impure and ugly.  She considers me as burden and asks me get married and go away(arrange marraige) but i don't want to marry. I even tried to commit suicide at one point but something made me stop, then i realized i am a coward in dying too.   My father is good to me but i don't think he is good to my mother in their days of early marraige but now he is fine , the only reason i live is him but i can't share these things with him, i am scared he will end up hating me. I am sure i won't share these with my dad because my moom is rude to my dad too and i know their marraige is a failure. Both of them don't like each other, but for the sake of society they are staying together.  I just don't know how to end my life, it's hell everyday. Moving out is not possible in my country. Did anyone experienced situation like mine and fortunately overcome it? Please help me. "	sw
"Can't focus at work. Live alone. Never been great at socializing, nobody at work has ever liked me. Just kinda over it. 30 female. Single but not pressed about it. History of all sorts of crazy stuff, parents love me but in their own way. I can't remember the last time anybody in my family asked me anything about my day or what's been going on. Nobody knew my major for almost two years. I asked my dad once and he couldn't even answer me.  Sometimes I'll talk to my dad but when I was a kid he has always used me as his therapist, and after I put my foot down a few years ago we barely talk at all. I barely talk to the rest of my family and I've told them how tough its been lately. Still nobody talks to me or answers my calls even though they are on their phones all day. My extended family hang out a lot but my mom is the black sheep so we don't get invited anywhere unless it's the holidays and then my mom will often just cause some underhanded drama. I'm 30 and only just now in school, i don't even have my associates degree. I think I might have a learning disability, I've always been really inquisitive and I know a lot but as far as putting it into school work I'm often frustrated and don't get things finished. I plan things out but don't always follow through. It will take me hours to study snd when I'm done I just kinda go ""I didn't even get anything done what happened""  Moved around a lot when I was a kid. A new school every year until 10th grade. No matter where I've gone I haven't made long term friends or any friends at all. I've always been bullied. I have high self confidence but low self worth and self esteem. Sometimes I think I am prettier than I maybe am. The friends I have made are great, but will say things like ""I've stuck up for you a lot,"" without telling me what I'm doing. Sometimes I think I'm just totally unaware of what I'm doing. Some people automatically dislike me especially some other women. Guys I do date are generally great but I run them off.  I think I've been suicidal since I was 10-12. Attempted three times as a teenager and kinda rode the ""I'm still here so there has to be a reason"" thing. Lately though it hasn't been working.  I'm easily frustrated with myself. I complain a lot, like way too much. I was super duper entitled though my 20s. Now I've calmed down but I have no idea how to act most of the time.  I have a therapy appointment on Thursday. I'm hoping to get some sort of coping techniques. Maybe advice. My last two therapists were awful. I'm medicated but I'm just totally stressed out and I don't know if it will end soon or not.  Sometimes I just don't even know. I'm trying to hold out bc my grandma but I barely see her since I work so often. I work 5 days a week and take 12 credits and live alone and my plants are all dying, I don't know why. Even though I'm in school full time I will probably be 35-36 before I have my bachelors. I have a job in my field but I'm not doing as well as my boss likes. It's such a great company and he knows everyone else in the field in the area so if I leave then I think I will have trouble getting hired.  I'm just so lost. "	sw
"I swam my first full lap today :) I am in my 30s. Starting learning to swim only a few weeks ago.

I never thought I would reach this stage. Feels good!"	cc
"How do y’all organize your music playlists? So I’m relatively young but I’m absolutely neck deep in music. I use Spotify and the native Apple app (for mixtapes and CD’s that you can’t stream) and I was super overwhelmed by the sheer amount of music I had amassed. My Spotify looks like this - https://imgur.com/a/ljCfy  Each playlist has between 50-300 songs on it. I had to create more to separate out my music because I’d have playlists with different genres and sounds in it, and it was just a weird listening experience.  So, to my question!   How do you all organize what you listen to? Do you break it down by release years? Genres? Etc?  And an example: I’ve really been getting into ‘60s-‘80s music of all genres and have been making up a bunch of playlists for that. I have one for the 60’s, 70’s, 80’s and so on. Now my dilemma is that I want each one to sound cohesive, but I wasn’t around back then. So to me, a some of the late 60’s stuff sounds like it should be grouped with 70’s stuff.   Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix and Creedence all had very popular (nowadays anyway) albums come out in ‘68 or ‘69. But they sound like 70’s songs to me. Do I include them in with the 70’s songs? Because then they wouldn’t be true decades playlists, but having Zeppelin and Jimi and Creedence with like The Doors, Buffalo Springfield, The Yardbirds, etc sounds kinda weird?   What are your thoughts? And if you have recommendations, shoot them at me! "	cc
"Hoping on Death It's been a long time since I've felt true happiness - almost to the point where I can't remember.  Along the way, especially the past two years or so, I've discovered a part of my mind I never knew existed.  The best way I cope is with words and music, so I might be able to turn this into a published novel by the end.  The first and only girl I loved that ever ""loved"" me back destroyed me.  Best I can say is that I battled her mental illnesses with her, and in return I got used, cheated, played, and abused.  It's almost like she's the person I used to be and I am the person she used to be - depressed, anxious, bipolar, suicidal.  Not to mention that in the midst of all of the pain, one of my best friends was killed.  I think the pain of her leaving was honestly worse and I can't explain it, but they were mostly all I had, and gone in an instant.  I've been waiting for them to call for years, and have finally deleted their phone numbers and given up.    They're not the only ones I'm waiting on.  Some of my other close ""friends"" don't talk to me anymore because my coping mechanism in writing, must have scared them away from me on social media.  Another friend of mine (who I even thought could've eventually been my girlfriend) will say she misses me, yet never makes an attempt to talk to me, let alone meet up in person.  She's starting college soon and I've come to realize that we'll probably never speak again.  My other friend hasn't reached out to me since I told him I had to be with my family (dad was diagnosed with cancer). Nobody gives a shit.  I have persistent anxiety around people to the point where I don't go out.  My heart races behind the wheel and in most public situations.  I'm very paranoid and afraid.  Bipolar.  Depressed.  All the things the girl I used to love was.  I'm literally haunted by her when I sleep some nights.  I wake up in a sweat or sleep into the afternoon.  I just want to feel wanted by someone who wants me back, and I've made that impossible.  It's to the point now where I'm thinking about deleting all my social media because it doesn't matter regardless.  I don't want to see everyone's perfect life and I don't want to relapse and lose my mind on a stupid website for everyone to see again.  I hate everyone who is happy and I hate myself because of it.  The only thing I have left is my passion for music and desire to become an artist someday, but even that is slowly becoming a spite filled goal... just to show the people I probably wrongfully hate that I am something."	sw

Your dream will always be there, waiting for you. And you can keep thinking: maybe, someday..."	cc
"Hopeless I’ve always been the type to overcompensate to try keep people around me, id be anyone but me because my opinion on myself is that low that no one would like me for me. I’m currently 21 and feel all I’ve had to offer, I’ve given and I’m reaching my limit, I’m not saying that my reason for wanting to end things revolves around the lack of company in my life, but it’s definitely contributing. I grew up with a turbulent family life, my dad died 8 years ago and that’s probably where things really went downhill for me, because it left me with loads of regrets. I don’t talk to family about my problems because they have their own lives, own families, own problems to deal with, so there’s just no time for me really. I feel super useless in life and maybe I’m just a waste of oxygen, a waste of resources, I don’t know I’m just not what the world wants or needs"	sw

"I miss having a close connection with my friends I hope you guys are all having awesome days! I'm just gonna rant here for a second okay?  I used to have a tight knit group of friends at my old community college. We would spend every day together and I remember looking forward to every day because of it. We just enjoyed being around each other and it made every day fun.  Last year I graduated. I transferred to a university in the same town, but I had one friend move to a different state. Another friend is moving to another state in a week, and after this quarter my closest friend will be most likely moving out of state as well. I don't get to see them very often as it is, and I miss these guys. We truly care about each other. I miss having that close connection.  Throughout the year I've realized that the friends i've made at my university is just no substitute for that. Since we all live in the same dorm there ends up being a lot of drama. Sure, I had drama in my last friend group, but it wasn't anything as common or petty as this. It's less of a ""I-want-to-hang-out-with-these-people"" type thing and more like a ""I-live-with-these-people-so-I-better-get-along-with-them"" thing. There's so much talk that I feel like if I make one wrong move or say something weird they're going to find me annoying and not want to talk to me. I understand that this in itself it incredibly petty and I realize that these people just make me self-conscious.  It's spring break now, and I'm thinking I'm just going to have to distance myself from all of my friends this quarter. We'll all be moving out soon anyways, so I might as well get used to spending less time with them. I was hoping to find a roommate for next year, but it might just be best that I go out on my own. Plus I'm taking harder classes, and it would probably be beneficial for me to focus on my studies.   Anyways thanks for letting me rant. Let me know if you've had any similar experiences, or any advice, or telling me im being overdramatic or something.  "	cc

Spent some time in the psych ward but that didn't really help much. I still want to die but my BF has locked all of my meds away from me and I cannot access them without his help. The only thing I can still think about it dying. They say I should go back to the psych ward but what good would that even do? Im in school and I have to work, I can't just walk away from that.

I am afraid of the future, and my whole body aches.  I just want to go. I need to. Dunno when or how, but it's been too much. Noone can help me, I am terrible. Falling asleep to my devastating thoughts is horrendeous. I'm so lonely, even surrounded by other people. I have already left this world behind, and now I am breaking down.  I'm so so so so sorry. I want to change so much.... I hate myself so much. Why am I so sick??    I don't know when I'll finally do it, but it's my only option. I'm dead and done, and have been for long.

"Application I'm confident I'm a strong candidate for a completed suicide. I have a number of risk factors. For instance, I'm over a white male over 50, with low career success, numerous setbacks, and low ability to cope with stressful life events.  Other factors also point to an elevated risk of a successful suicide. I often feel a thwarted sense of belonging. In psychological testing, I score low on Openness to Experience (OTE) and high in Neuroticism. My reaction to stressful events is rigid and uncreative, often exacerbating the problems I'm trying to address. I see myself as a burden to others. I live alone, and I have never had a partner for longer than four months. Those relationships have been few, and years apart. I do not have many confidantes, and none nearby. I spend most of my days alone, and I rarely have the desire to go out.   I don't plan on commiting suicide tonight or the next, but I doubt I'll live past my 50s. It's reasonable to think that I'll be dead, by my own hand, within the next five years. "	sw

He had a hospital band on and, when I asked about it, he opened up by saying that he had tried to kill himself a few days prior.

"I think I'm finally at peace with the thought of dying I've been through a number of depressive episodes over the last couple of years and have considered suicide a number of times, but I think I'm finally ready to die. I just finished rewriting my suicide note. I plan on spending the Easter holidays with my family and a few old friends and when I come back to the town in which I currently live I'm going to finally put an end to my life and be at peace after so many years of trying to find a purpose to exist. I'm going to try to be as good and as helpful to as many people as I can over the next week. I don't think I was a good person during my life. My depression made me bitter and angry and I regret that now. I know one week can't fix that, but it's all I can do with the time I have left.   The purpose of this post is not to ask for help, I feel like I am finally ready to take the long nap at this point.

"I am very depressed. I don't know where to start to put this into context.   I guess I'll start from the start and try to keep it coherent and short as possible.   My mom is an alcoholic, I always said I'd never drink like she did. I'm typing this as I'm more than halfway through a bottle of brandy in one sitting.   That's number one.   Number two is I want to get out of my dead-end job and I have EVERY opportunity to study wise as my dad is paying for everything and yet I can't. I drink myself to oblivion and can't focus and study because of it.   My current job exhausts me beyond compare, it's not reasonable 'working under pressure' circumstances. I am pulled into every direction, blamed for everything and have to pay for every mistake out of my own pocket even if it is not my mistake. If I am not paying for it, I get guilt-tripped.

Sorting my finances, getting my emotions in check. It's all easy when I list them, but it never works.  "	sw

"Pitiful, Suicidal, Rottened and part of Earth's unwanted. I'm an only child who was abandoned by her dad at a confusing age and thoroughly abused by her mother after the divorce. It wasn't until my first relationship did I feel loved. And then when we broke up after their infidelity, I shut off into a mute, pitiful and 'sleep, eat, sleep' life isolated from school, work, or life.  It seems everyone has family or friends that are always there to pull them off their feet. I know I can make my own family and friends but based on my experiences, people just want to use me or hurt me in some way.  It's pushed me into feeling worthless until the point where I reach for help. But then I have people who ask me to do things like let them own me or stream my suicide.  I feel sick. I feel disgusted. And I feel that I should just die."	sw
"I just realized how much of my life has been eaten up by online gaming. So I've spent 9998 hours on Runescape in the last 15+ years just on my 3 main accounts, not counting time on ""pures"" (alternate accounts for pvping). That's 416.6 days or an average of around 2 hours a day since I started playing.  That's not including the time I've spent on other major MMO titles when I took breaks from Runescape. I also played DAOC, EVE, Anarchy Online, and a few others more briefly.  Do I feel like it was a waste of time? Honestly not at all, a lot of people spend far more time watching television and there's at least some genuine cognitive benefits to my addiction. I do however recognize it's an addiction and probably occupies my thoughts more than it should."	cc

"I Don't Want to Hurt Myself I don't really know where else to go our what else to do. I feel like I just need to tell someone how close I really am to taking my life. I am terrified I am going to hurt myself.  I live with crippling anxiety. Depression. PTSD.  After a few years of therapy, I was starting to do better. My depression and anxiety were almost gone. Just normal nervousness, something I could totally deal with.  Now I'm starting a new business while still working a full-time job. I am trying to balance a crazy work schedule, be a good husband, a good human to 2 dogs.  I have such a good life. My wife is so supportive. She came home from work the other day just to be with me (I work from home) because I was having a breakdown. She supports me through all of my crazy business ideas. She supported me going back to school. She is always there for me and I am terrified I am letting her down. How long can she possibly take this?   I wake up every morning drenched already in a panic attack.   I feel like I am letting down everyone around me. My current employer, who I am obviously no longer committed to and not putting all my effort into the job I NEED to pay my bills. I am letting down my business partner because I can't always be at our brand new office because I need to put the hours into my job that pays my bills. I am letting down my wife and dogs, who I am neglecting by working 20 hours a day. I am letting down my parents who I never call, or see.  I feel like I am living my dream, starting a new business I am passionate about, with a partner who is already very successful. I have such an amazing wife and family. I have great ""things"" even though I sort of live paycheck to paycheck.  I have no right to feel so depressed and negative. I have no reason to be on the brink of suicide. But I am.  I think about it constantly.  I spend my waking hours in or near panic state. I am constantly walking on eggshells. I vomit 3-5 times a day. My feet are sore from pacing for hours on end. My eyes are red and face is purple from vomiting constantly. I fractured a rib from vomiting.  I hold my Lexapro and Ativan in my hands several times a day and think that if I just took all of these, drank as much booze I could find in my home, and went to sleep maybe I just wouldn't wake up.  How could I do that to my wife? I couldn't imagine her finding me that way.  I know she is scared I will kill myself. She told me the other day that she didn't know what she was going to come home to find.  I am closer than I have ever been before to actually killing myself.  I made an appointment with my therapist for Wednesday morning, but that means I have to neglect both of my jobs for at least 2 hours. I have to leave my house which I am terrified to do. AND I have to make it to Wednesday.  I really don't know what to do anymore. I just want the pain to be over. I can't live like this anymore."	sw

"Excitement about a future you might not get to experience? It's a crazy modern world we live in with so much science and innovation happening constantly and I understand none of it. I am not intelligent or passionate enough to learn the world enough to add to it, but, I experience as much of others achievements as I can. I am particularly excited about the notion of combing the human body with technology. Whether it is from birth with something like CRISPr or being able to access internet from anywhere on/off Earth with an implant, all biotech interests me something vicious. Though, when I converse of the future and the possibilities of humans, most people only discuss how fearful of technology they are. They don't fear the robot in their hands that they cannot separate from but they are scared of a robot living inside them that regulates their health...hmm.  Anyone else excited for the future and not fearful of AI and such? Anyone actually smart and want to enlighten me on why I should be scared?

"Should I take the job with more pay but longer commute or stay at current job that's closer to home but with less pay? I've been lurking this subreddit for a while and have never made a post but you all seem nice and reasonable people so I'd like to ask for some advice!  At my friend's job there is a 8am-5pm position with weekends off that pays $17/hr but it's far from where I live so I would have to commute 2+ hours a day. My current job is 7:30am-4:30pm also with weekends off, pays $12/hr, and is only a little over an hour commute a day. The new job has possibilities of getting a promotion while at my current job there is absolutely none.  Having my current job gives me time to go to the gym and relax at home after work. The new job would mean I have to wake up earlier, deal with traffic 5 days out of the week, less sleep, and less leisure time after work. I'm sure it seems silly but I've had a job with a long commute before and it was draining. I had no time to do anything except eat dinner and maybe watch an episode of something on Netflix so I could then go to bed early to wake up at 5am... but $17/hr is so much money to me. So much lol.  I've already applied for it and I've been asking my friends about what I should do... the majority say to take the job if I get the offer but I'd like to hear what everyone else thinks. :)"	cc

"Suicidal thoughts, I don't believe this is wrong Hey guys. I have a lot of physical and mental problems. I hope to see a therapist soon. I have made mistakes, really bad mistakes. I'm 23 years old and I feel like an old man. I am agnostic. I feel that death is not a bad thing. It is quite interesting. Perhaps something good will happen, maybe nothing? Maybe I will be in peace. Recently I've been contemplating suicide, but not so much. It's kinda like a last resort if anything goes really wrong. Is this wrong? Am I noble for being optimistic about death? I have considered the pros and cons. The benefit is that I won't hurt anyone anymore directly, and I won't hurt myself by not existing. But on the flip side, my parents and siblings will be heart broken. I am generally happy, but sometimes these mistakes I make, I can't tell anyone. It's not like I killed anyone or ever physically hurt someone. I consider myself to be a really kind and good person, many people say the same. But I have no friends and society generally sees me as a problem. Im all alone, constantly dealing with anxiety. For the past 3 years, there hasn't been one day that I haven't been anxious. I have been trying hard to stay optimistic this whole time, but in the end I just secluded myself being a shut in. Any thoughts on my views on suicide? Is it okay if things go really really wrong? The probability that such a terrible event may occur is hopefully only 0.00001%, but there is still a chance and a chance of something bad happening means that I need a plan. A backup plan. I'm afraid of pain, my physical condition has made me want to stay away from any pain. Is there even a painless way to die?"	sw

I don’t feel any better/healthier, I feel like I’ve lost part of my identity as well as something that brought me joy.   The reason I haven’t started again, is because I don’t want to have to go through what I went through quitting the first time again, (quit cold turkey) it was horrible.   Am I the only one?

"I'm helping I've been helping a lady trailer loading her young, very flighty horse. I use clicker training: Rewarding every step in the right direction, not prompting but letting the animal choose to move when it's ready. It is very different from ""traditional"" methods, which usually mean applying pressure (with varying degrees of force) until the horse moves in the right direction.   For context, it's a new technology and many horse people are very sceptical of it (the dog world has come a lot further), and choose the tried and true aversion based methods. Which in general work just fine, I got no beef with it, it's just not great when there is fear and tension in the picture since the pressure can add to that tension. Being restrained or pushed when you're scared will often increade that fear, and scared animals are dangerous, especially big ones.   So the other day, this horse with a history of rearing and throwing himself backwards to avoid being devoured by the black hole that is the trailer, choose to walk calmly and happily straight into it without any prompt or guidence from us. Ears forward, long strides, he looked very pleased with himself. I love seeing that.   What I really love though is how the owners change when they learn about reward based training. They start out with a stubborn, stupid or scared animal, and end up with a smart, eager and brave one. The horse or dog is the same of course, except for some different behaviours, but the owners perception of them change and that tends to become a self fulfilling prophecy. It's just a shift of focus, but it is everything. Instead of trying to get rid of the bad stuff, we focus on the good stuff and make it grow until there is no room for bad stuff anymore (btw thos attitude tends to spill over into other aspects of life which is amazing). Seeing owners beaming with pride, smiling from ear to ear,  is just the best feeling in the world.   "	cc

"I don’t know what to do Hi, I am sorry for mistakes, English is not my mother language.  I am a girl and I turned 14 few weeks ago. I started thinking about suicide about a year ago due to bullying at school. I love my mother and I am pretty sure she loves me too, but sometimes she probably doesn’t know how to make me behave better.  I find it very hard to talk to people and I am not good at anything. I can’t even do what I like (horseriding) because we can’t afford it. I am one of the top students in my class, but now I am too tired to learn and I cheat in all the tests. I have been struggling with depression a lot and I don’t think someone noticed. I don’t have friends and I will never find someone to love, neither to marry- I think I am gay and my country is really homophobic. I am also quite ugly.  A year ago, my mom started coughing. It never stopped and she acts like nothing is happening. I think she may be really ill and it makes me very worried and depressed too. I am scared. I love my mother but she sometimes beats me and shouts at me really bad words. She doesn’t believe me when I tell her for example that I fell bad or something hurts me(for example: once I broke 3 of my fingers and she refused to take me to the hospital). She says that not having friends is my fault because I don’t talk with them and I don’t want them as friends. That’s not true, I really try but my classmates don’t like me. They already have enough friends.  When I come from school, I am just home laying on the bed playing games on iPad. I used to read a lot but I lost all interest in doing something. I think about suicide all the time and I really want to kill myself but I am worried about my mom (I live only with her), grandparents and my two guinea pigs.   I think it would really hurt my mom if I killed myself but I just can’t live like this anymore.  sorry for the long post"	sw

"Do people think your older or younger than your actual age? I usually get older.   Personality wise: I have a friend who’s three years older than me, and I’m friends with her because her sister and I have been best friends for six years. Well my friend who’s older, we’ll call her Racheal, has always told me, “There’s no way your (my age)” Racheal and I often have deep talks late at night and I guess I have a more *mature* perspective on things.   Then I’ve had quite a few internet friends who have always thought I was much older than I actually am. I’ve been on the internet for a long time, staring at a pretty young age. Being in the ass crack of conservative Texas, I probably would of had more conservative views and whatnot. But from being online at such a young age, I got to hear the perspective of things from different people. I guess that’s what’s shaped me to have a more mature personality because I always hung out with people who were much older. The thing is I never told any of my internet friends my age and they think I’m 3-5 years older than I actually am.   Then looks wise: I’ve not ever had one person tell me that I seemed older than I actually was. I feel like I look my age, but I think from how I dress people think I’m a few years older. Also my voice probably has a lot to do with that too. I naturally have a lower voice, especially when I talk to people who aren’t my friends. My voice tends to sink down into my throat and gets a bit lower.   Do you often get mistaken for being older or younger than you actually are?  "	cc

I think of leaving myself to hang from the office or somewhere in the public I work in or slash my throat somewhere in public for a brutal display, somewhere in a store never to be recovered.

One insignificant thing that nobody really cares about but you do. It could be a game, a girl, a celebrity, a dog, bird, whatever. Anything. For me it's the flowers. I'll have such a bad day and I'll come across a flower and I think to myself ""If I die, I'll never see another flower again. I'll never hold a rose, a tulip, a daisy.""

Or suddenly our heart just stops and all we can say is: ""Oh well, guess I forgot how to keep the ol' popper ticking. People did remind me to keep living, after all. Silly me!""   As I said, these comments probably came from a very good place, I just want to reinforce the fact that the stories of suicidal people are not emotional attractions for people to ride. We just want help, validation and support. We're not here for reminders that someone out there will love us, or reminders to breathe.    Maybe it's just me, perhaps I've gotten more bitter after years of feeling this way. I personally just don't find comments like that helpful. To me it makes you look like you're there to leech off of other people's misery so you can feel better about yourself, while still submitting low-effort ""helpful"" comments so you can make yourself believe that you did something good. If anything it makes me want to do it more.  To those that can't relate to this, those that know they genuinely care and always make sure their comments are heartfelt and lengthy. You are a great person and this is definitely not directed at you.   I just wish people would stop giving that ""light at the end of the tunnel"" bullshit while completely overlooking and gleefully ignoring the gigantic hurdle that someone just talked about. Positive thinking only gets someone so far.  Thanks for reading."	sw

"I started training to run 5 km and was confronted with the jiggliness of my body After lurking on /r/C25K (Couch To 5 Km) for a bit, I decided it was time to stop lurking and to start actively participating. I used to be in decent shape, back when I still played football (soccer) 5 times a week. In the last 4 years, however, I moved to a new city for university, I never signed up for a sports club or gym in that new city, and I have been struggling with a long-lasting depression. When you combine those things with not the healthiest of eating habits, a penchant for drinking when the depression is at its worst and not seeing the point of making changes to my lifestyle because of the depression, you get what I had become: lazy, overweight and horribly out of shape.  Lately, I have been doing better. I have been going to therapy, I stopped drinking altogether, I started to put more effort into my meals, I picked up some hobbies I had abandoned and I started to learn how to deal with my depression. Physical activity, however, was still lacking.  To change that, I joined the C25K program. Last week, I did my first trial run. I wanted to find out if the new shoes I bought were comfortable enough, figure out the right set-up for my gps-watch, and just get all of the niggly stuff out of the way so that I can make a good start with the program next week.   The first minute of running was very confrontational. I was able to finish it without too much difficulty, but I felt something I had not felt before. I jiggled. My belly jiggled. My upper legs jiggled. Even my lower back jiggled. I knew I was overweight, but I am not morbidly obese by any stretch of the imagination, and I had been telling myself that it really wasn't all that bad, but this run prooved that it is, indeed, pretty bad.  Four months ago, that realization would probably have made me quit right away, go back home, start spiralling into a depressive episode, go on a binge and feeling useless for the next week or so. But not this time. I took some rest to order my thoughts, accept what I felt, realised that I was working on what I felt at that exact moment and prepared myself for the next 60 seconds of running.   It feels good to have made this step. I know the program is going to be hard, but I feel like I can do it. Maybe not in the 9 weeks it's intended to be finished in, maybe not without setbacks, but I WILL finish it!  Have any of you made the step to get in better shape? What are some of the setbacks you encountered? And how did you overcome them?"	cc
Don’t call anyone. Tried to kill myself last night. Drank a bunch and took a bunch of muscle relaxants. Wrote a note. After all the sexual abuse after all the anger after everything I just wanted to end it. But then woke up with puked up blood all over the pillows and my cat on top of me. And residual feeling of overwhelming guilt and anger and feelings of wishing myself dead.   My cat needs someone to take care of her. I can be that person.   What’s with the blood on my pillow? Why did that happen? That’s the part I don’t understand 	sw
"I feel trapped I don't want to commit suicide, but I feel like it's my only option. I've failed 4 semesters at college now, I'm an obvious fuck up. I just can't do school. I absolutely hate it and I don't think there are any professional fields I find interesting enough to go to school for. I don't want a minimum wage job, I'd kill myself if I had to work one anyways. So what can I do then? There really isn't anything else. I'm not good at anything, I have trouble focusing on things, I've been told at a previous job that I was incompetent so I guess I don't belong in the work place anyways. It seems obvious to me that killing myself is the best way to go since I have no where else to go. But if you have suggestions I'd like to hear them first."	sw
"The most annoying feeling Have you ever felt the feeling of being extraordinarily bored? Like, you want to do a lot of things such as reading something, watching or even going to some places but at the same time, you do not want to anything at all. You've tried doing the things you wanted but couldn't finish doing it.  I really think that this is the most annoying feeling I've ever felt. I feel like I'm wasting my time trying to figure what I really wanted to do or what I should do to entertain and satisfy myself for the day.  What do you guys do in times like this? "	cc
"I wrote a bunch of different variations of (kind of detailed) suicide notes and pieces about it, read if you want. Writing has helped me calm down a little Note 1: the philosopher There really isn’t a point to life. If I spend my entire existence trying to help people, the people I helped will just die off with time. I will die, they will die, and any memory of us will die too. But the earth will go on. Nature will continue, uninterrupted by my demise. Unflinching. The trees will never fear their own mortality. I will rot into their soil and they will grow stronger from my decomposing corpse.  So why is it that we value human life above all else? Why is your soul worth more than the rabbit under the ferns if you will both be eaten by the same worms, if you will become the same dust? Is it a basic myth that we tell ourselves to justify our violence against other creatures?  What is the logic of people who think they’ve found their purpose? Do they believe that they will make a lasting difference? A few generations, sure, but nothing lasts. Everything we know today will one day crumble under the feet of new generations, forgotten like the birthdays of extended families.  Note 2: the fml I’ve been thinking about Andrew a lot lately. Is this how he felt? Is this the fate we left him too? No, probably not. He had more problems than I do. I just consider suicide after every heartbreak because is living really worth going through this again.   I don’t want to start over again. I don’t want to start a new life in a new city and make new friends. I never want to fall in love again. I don’t want to feel like this when it all falls apart. I don’t want to feel this pain again. I know you’re saying that my life won’t fall apart like this again, but you’re wrong. It’s happened before. I fuck up the same way every time and I can’t stop. I’m lucky if someone stays my friend for a few months at this point.  I can’t handle the cycles of my own life. I probably need to be medicated, institutionalized, lobotomized for my own good.  I’ve craved death for a long time and I don’t know what’s different about now. Maybe I’m getting weaker with age. Oh well.   Note 3: the bae Justin, Im sorry. I don’t want you to think this was your fault. It wasn’t. I love you.  I loved you.  But I fucked up. I fucked everything up like I always do and I can’t live with myself knowing that. I want you to be happy. Forget about me. Please.  This is the third time I’ve tried writing this note, but it’s the only one addressed to you. I was trying to pretend that you weren’t the most important thing in my life when I was writing those and it just felt wrong.  So I have to write to you.  Just you. The plane tickets I bought for this summer in Europe are in my name, but I want you to take them. Go for me. Ask my dad for my laptop and everything should still be logged in for you. The password is ********. I didn’t want to see the world alone anyways. While you’re in my email, please email Kathy ***** and let her know what has happened. She is a good friend of mine and I don’t want her to think I am ignoring her. She does not deserve that.  You can have whatever you want from my stuff, just please make sure that my great grandmother’s wedding ring makes it back to my mom. It’s in the jewelry box next to my bed.  Your shirts should be in my laundry bin. They’re clean but I couldn’t keep looking at them, so they’re there.  I’m sorry to leave you with this. You shouldn’t be responsible for me anymore but I’m afraid you’re the only person I trust to do it.  I don’t know when exactly I’ll do it yet. I was planning on jumping off of the bridge when I’m in San Francisco but it would cost my family a lot to ship my body home once it’s found. Maybe I’ll ******** or ******* myself to death. We’ll see.  I should have talked to you when we were together but I just brushed our problems under the rug like they never even existed. I guess that was my biggest mistake. I’m sorry that I hurt you that way, I should have been there for you. I should have been by your side. I wish you could know the real me. I spent so much time trying to pretend I was normal so that you might be able to love me that I never really got to know you either. I guess, if you want, you can read my journals and letters. All they will tell you is that I have been very, very sad for a long time.  Please know that this wasn’t your fault. You did what you thought was best for you and that’s exactly what you should have done. I was not good for you.  Give your cats some pats for me.  Until we meet again,  Note 4: the formal apology  This is not your fault. This is not anyone’s fault but my own. I wasn’t strong enough to handle the things that I brought onto myself, even with all of the help in the world.  I am sorry to put my friends and family through what I know is to come of this, but I hope they all understand that this is for the best.  Layla, Chris,... I am sorry to put you through this again. No one should have to face that kind of loss, but I am unable to handle myself. I have no will to live to see another day, another sunset, another first kiss. The light does not outweigh the dark in my life, and if the same is true in your own life, I hope that you are stronger than I have been.  The people I once thought to be my friends no longer care to say hello to me in passing. Many of the people who I once loved and called my friends distrust and, in some cases, despise me. It hurts me to remember what once was, knowing that the loss of the things that once made my life live-able has resulted from my own actions. I have tried to be better but I have failed. Mom, Dad... I am sorry that you have to burry a child and I am sorry that I will not live long enough to make you as proud as I has once hoped I would. Now, at least, you can worry about yourselves and find happiness. I am also sorry for the people that helped raise me, the family members and teachers and neighbors with whom I was extraordinarily close. I hope they know that they have not failed me, but I them.  I apologize the most for the friends I rarely see. My penn pals, my long time no sees. They will wonder where I have gone. Someone who has access to my laptop, please let Kathy **** know what has happened to me. Her email should be in a folder labeled pen pals. She is a good friend, and has been for many years, and I do not want her to think that I have left her. She does not deserve that.  On the other hand, please do not idolize this. I was hated by many, disliked by even more. Please do not allow those who belittled, attacked and degraded me use my death as a tool for dealing with their fears of their own mortalities. If they did not already know that this was coming, they were not a friend. I am not asking for blame because that will just be more painful, but please, don’t lie to make yourselves feel better about this. Come to terms with yourselves. If you must blame someone, blame me. If you want to blame truthfully, blame society.   Those friends who knew this was coming will probably be hit the hardest. I am sorry. There is nothing that they could’ve done. I have struggled with depression for many years. I began self harming in elementary school, more notably as I grew older. I have abused drugs and alcohol and men for years in order to deal with my emotional issues. To those I have caused suffering in trying to deal with this— Anthony, Justin— I am, again, sorry. Although I have tried to hide the issues in my life from those around me, it has become increasingly difficult for me, so it is likely that you suspected this. I don’t need to list every terrible thing that has ever happened to me to justify my choices— many of you already know— and if I did do so it would likely be seen as manipulative. Yes, I have sought out psychiatric help and therapy, I’ve tried every outlet for my emotions... art, writing, music, sports, sex, drugs, love... and it has been ineffective. I have developed digestion and joint issues as a result of my stress. I often cry so hard that I throw up. Although I have been very happy, I am more often than not very, very sad.  There are some people who chose to abandon me even knowing that this was coming, some of which I know care very much about me and are trying to help themselves. I am sorry to have pushed you away. I would have liked very much for our relationships to have ended on a higher note.  I am disappointed in myself and my actions throughout my lifetime and have come to realize that no number of good deeds will have me forget this. I have been a bad granddaughter, a bad student, a bad peer, a bad friend, and a bad girlfriend. I realize now that my past cannot be shaken. It seems that journalism, the only thing I truly thrived in, brought only more unhappiness to my social standing despite my love for it. This letter is probably my least edited piece of writing.  This looks much more like an apology than what it truly is, but that is because suicide is often miscommunicated. I am not doing this because of my last heart break or a bad grade or anything so trivial. I do not want anyone to be blamed for this, I did everything I could to make sure no one would be able to stop me. Please do not say I had a bright future ahead of me— those who have known me well know that this is the only ending I have available to myself, it was just a matter of when. It could’ve been twenty years from now, but I would have just suffered longer. Although there are people to whom I would like to write individually, I have chosen not to do so to spare their psyches. I don’t want to pour my heart out when it wouldn’t change anything. I know this because, in the most relevant cases, I already have. If they want to hear from me again, give them my rough drafts and my journals. There is enough for another 20 years of conversation with me, at least.  I have contemplated this for many years and I am sorry to leave you all with this emotional burden.  I wish you the best,  Note 5: pov I am standing on the San Francisco Bay bridge and I will not survive my jump.  Tomorrow, or maybe next week depending on the tides, they will find my body on the rocky shoreline.  My white lace dress will be heavy with cold Pacific water and my skin will be marked with scratches from the sea floor. Maybe my eyes will have rotted out by then, or have been taken by seagulls. I may not look like myself, but myself is not happy and I will be happy. I am in the city for a convention. I tell my roommates that I am leaving to take photos of the sun over the Bay. I will not come back. Although I look very put together on the convention floor, my friends at home know that I am not. If they haven’t already accepted it, they have a feeling in the back of their mind that I will not be coming home.         "	sw
"I've come to the end of the road. 23M. I'm tired. I'm so tired of all of this. I can't keep going when everyday just hurts me more. Everyday, I go to sleep and there's just one thing less to wake up to, and everyday, I just seem to be more exhausted than the day before. These last few months, I've just been grinding down to what I know will be my last day.   I've always been a social outsider. I've tried so hard to make friends, but I always seem overbearing to people who just never seem interested in being friends with me. People don't like me and they think I'm a complete prick. Everyday, there's just one more embarrassing that I've done to make a complete fool out of myself. I've only ever had one girlfriend, and she wound up cheating on me. It's been nearly a year since I last had sex.  Yesterday, I discovered that my boss and his fuckbuddy have been guessing what variation of autism I have. For months now, I've suspected that I have some sort of autism and I feel disgusting. People look at me like there's something wrong with me and now I know why. People see me as some charity case, and they look down at me. I know I'm weird and creepy and nobody likes me but it's got to be too much now. Nobody is interested in anything I have to say anymore, and I'm tired of rattling off whatever new fascinating thing I've learned about today only to discover nobody except me actually gives a single shit.  I feel completely trapped. I have no money and I am thousands of pounds in debt. I am addicted to painkillers. Nothing makes me happy except the brief fleeting joy I get from films and TV and my dog. I love her. But I can't leave, and I think I've seen too much of this wonderful world to be satisfied with this place.   The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because I am too much of a coward. Years of self harm have scared me out of anything so drastic. So now I'm trapped in this endless misery with no exit. I try to fill my time with writing this book I'm trying to get going, but that's not enough. It's not real. It doesn't need me.  Ultimately I think that's what I want. To be needed. But nobody needs me and nobody wants me. So I just wanted to put this here, just to show that I tried to reach out, or something. I don't know. I feel like a shitty person just posting this but I feel completely trapped. I'm sorry."	sw

"Fed up. I never thought I'd be posting on here. I've been contemplating on it for over a month now. I subscribed to reach out and help people. I've been off my medication for roughly a month (I've called in refills but they love to drag their feet) and I've informed the pharmacy I ran out weeks ago. I've been sober for 5, almost 6 months and I'm fucking miserable. I can't go a single day without the involuntary thoughts of using miscellaneous objects to take my own life. The moment I get a glimpse of a gun I think of how easy it would be. Sometimes, it's also been occurring more often recently, I have the desire to act on the compulsion. I'm running out quickly on the will to live and I have nobody I can talk to that I fully trust here. It's just becoming so difficult to even put forth the effort to breathe  My mind feels so scattered and I feel like I'm rotting on the inside The only reason I'm posting this is because I know healthy me would want me to do so"	sw
"If I tell a psychiatrist about suicidal thoughts, will I be hospitalized? Even if they aren't strong suicidal thoughts? Please tell me the truth.  After 3 years, I've finally recognized that I need to seek help for how I've been feeling. A lot of stress has hit recently that has just made everything so much more hopeless. I don't think I would commit suicide anytime soon, but the thought is constantly lingering in the back of my mind. I'm just afraid that I'll be hospitalized if I voice this.  There isn't a way to afford hospital treatment right now, I can barely scrape up enough for this first appointment, so if I were to be hospitalized, that would be even more stress. I know I shouldn't hold anything back, but I'm just scared of all the consequences. It was hard to come to terms with the fact that I need help, but if there are negative repercussions to seeing someone, I would rather find an alternative method to seeking help."	sw
"Locked up for reaching out A few weeks ago something happens where it made my boyfriend, my mom and basically everyone mad at me. My boyfriend was saying things to bring me down and was breaking up with me and when my mom drove me to school that next morning she didn’t say anything to me. After being clean probably two months or more from any real self harm, I didn’t have anything to use to take the anger out on myself with. I broke a pen thing and cut up my legs in the bathroom while I was texting the crisis line (which I thought was confidential). I ended up saying that I was gonna kill myself that night and that I was thinking about it which I was. It’s the closest I’ve been, but apparently then they called the school police and I was locked up done there until the social worker and my mom were there and they basically gave me no choice but to go to the hospital. I cried so hard and begged to go home but no one listened.  So I’m definitely not going to reach out for help again:) fuck that, I got attacked for that shit. "	sw

As for myself my studies are going pretty well so far. I have submitted 2 assignments so far (and on time!). For those interested I am majoring in psychology, and this trimester I am taking social psychology and cognitive psychology. Two fantastic choices I think. Social psychology in a nutshell is about understanding why we behave as we do in front of other people, it is about group dynamics, stereotyping, close and intimate relationships. Cognitive psychology is about things like object perception, memory; how we acquire, store and retrieve information. And I am also doing criminology as an elective, it has been great so far!

I have no friends and I get no calls. I'm all alone and a failure. I'm 26 years old now.

An honest review of the Purple Pillow I tried posting on their website but it was removed so here’s my honest opinion. I received this pillow 3 weeks after my birthday because apparently it takes 3 weeks to package and ship it. So after 1 month here you go.   Pros: Helps me sleep.  Breathable mesh causes air to gently blow on you when you move.  Extremely comfortable.   Cons: Has a funny plastic smell.  Weighs about 10 lbs.  Tends to get hot in the center even with the breath ability.  Is very flat so I have to stack it on another pillow.  Is 100$ but should be about half that.    Overall I’d give it a 3.5 pillows out of 5. Will this be the perfect pillow for you? Probably not. Would I rather just buy one of the 5$ puffy ones from target every 6 months? Yes probably.   Anyone else have one or have used one that agrees or disagrees with me?  	cc

"Today I woke up and felt different - I think I'm ready I've been getting my suicidal thoughts back for about a week now. I thought I was doing good. So good I even reduced the medication until about a month and a half ago I completely stopped taking it. The anxiety was gone, depression too, even my social anxiety wouldn't show up in social events. It was all gone. About a week ago it all came back. First the anxiety in the back of my mind, then the overwhelming sadness/depression and just after those two set in, the suicide thoughts showed up, again. I became violent towards my SO when my conflicted thoughts would show up and not shut up. I feel bad for reacting this way but it was either ""playfully"" hitting him (he said I wasn't hurting him) or take it out on me. I started withdrawing myself. Became a bit more silent. More ""in my thoughts"". He noticed, would ask if everything was okay but I was too ashamed to admit everything came back and shit hit the fan. So I just said I was fine. He knows better.  Today I woke up happy. I think because I came to terms that I need to leave and I think I'll do it. I've been showing all my love, being all kinds of caring. Hugging. Smiling. Reminding him how much I do in fact love him. I hope I have it in me today to break it to him that I am thinking of ending it one of these nights, maybe tonight, so he can help me.  I think enough is enough. I've been fighting these same thoughts, anxiety and depression since I was 14, I'm 20, turning 21 soon. I'll just embrace the thoughts so I'm less conflicted and angry, sad. It'll be okay."	sw
"Does anyone else miss working physically? I used to work in the warehouse of a big grocery store, taking care of bottles and crates mostly, when I was still in high school. Now I am working in an office and I have to say I miss the old job a bit. Of course the pay is better now, but I miss not having to think too much all the time and not having to worry about how my projects will go.  Anybody else having the same experience? Missing jobs that required less mental but more physical work?"	cc

"My grandma turned 97 yesterday! NINETY-freakin-SEVEN!! I’m just so amazed but not at all surprised. She is one tough broad, who would blush at me saying that. Actually now, with the Alzheimer’s, she might just say back “Darn right!” She’s gotten sassy these last years. I had flowers sent and the picture of her with them that my cousin sent just made my heart swell. She is my last living grandparent, two of whom I never met.  I grew up in the same house she raised her 8 children in. While my parents were working full time and going to college/grad schools in the evenings, she took care of me. I spent summer days helping sort through donations at the church thrift store that she managed. I visited her at the town lingerie store when she worked there. I kept out of the way when she hosted Reading Group, her weekly book club with all her old lady friends who took turns hosting. Pepperidge Farm cookies, coffee and tiny glasses of wine. Book talk that segued into town gossip. I loved the scent of perfume that lingered after they’d all left, and the lipstick prints left on the glasses. I also loved the leftover cookies.   I’ve been bracing myself for her passing, most seriously when she was hospitalized for the flu and pneumonia this winter. But those memories I have, and all I learned by watching her, won’t leave me, I just won’t let it.   97, way to go Nanny.   Anyway, thanks for reading ☺️ Good health and happiness to your grandparents, and if you’ve lost them I hope your memories and lessons never leave you. "	cc
"I met my ex on Yahoo! Answers before meeting internet strangers was common. in 2008, then I flew to a different country to be with them several times.   People always ask me ""who asked the question and who had the answer?""  But really Yahoo Answers was a lot like Reddit back then, and most people don't know this. It was like the pre-reddit place to be. It's divided into categories and all categories had their own regular users with a Top Contributer leaderboard and everything, so everyone knew each other. A lot of times we would just ask questions of the community to chat and get to know each other personally, and you could add friends and talk through private message.   Is anyone here an oldschool Y!A regular? Or, did you meet someone in an unlikely online place?"	cc
"Life doesn't get better  I've tried it all. Opening up to people, being held in a hospital for three weeks, therapy, antidepressants, everything. You don't come back better or the same from this, you come back worse than in the first place. This seriously may be one of my last days alive. Turned 18 a few days ago and have no friends, social skills, girlfriend, accomplishments, still a virgin, addicted to porn.   I'm at not even going to get into college because I'm so stupid. I hate myself so much. I don't want to cry anymore, I don't want to cut myself anymore, I don't want these thoughts and feelings anymore, I don't want these voices inside my head anymore, I don't want these pills anymore, I can't live another day.  What's the point when I go through pain every single breathing second of my worthless ""life"". I've tried and tried and tried just to end up being worse. I'm sorry to everyone, I'm just a loser. Even when I was in the hospital my brother told me that he's glad I was there because no one would deal with me. Or maybe the time he said to my face that I should killed myself, yeah I'm living life...  To anyone who has ever helped me, Thank You! I just can't see myself going any longer. I have a million reasons to end it all but not one reason to stay. Nobody would care if I was gone, I'm sorry!"	sw
"There’s No Reason to, But I Wish I Had One I feel terrible about the fact that I contemplate whether I should commit suicide or not. People who are struggling with very traumatic issues commit suicide to escape the agony of the ripples of these travesties and I’m just sitting in my bed at night, unreasonably sad, and I want to just feel something even if it’s the last breath leaving my lungs. I’ve no reason to leave this world but I feel as if I should, I wake up day in day out just feeling nothing, wanting nothing more than to just fade away.  My childhood was shit but life for me (besides mentally) is fine. Maybe I just miss my mother, maybe it’s the lack of a father figure, being stuck in a small town, having to see old scars of self harm, I don’t know. I’m just sad and don’t want to be around anymore. I have a tattoo for my mother saying “Resilience is my Promise” but I don’t know how resilient I am anymore and if I can keep my promise. It feels as if I have nothing left to give and I’m losing this fight to myself. My biggest enemy is me and I’m just demolishing myself to the point where I just want to die. Maybe self hatred can be my reason, it seems logical now."	sw
"Happy Thursday! Congratulations! You made it past hump day. I would give you all a cookie if that was even remotely feasible. (My estimate is that it would cost me £8,562,300 to buy each of you a cookie. This is an enormous subreddit...)  What are your tips and tricks to making the week more bearable?

"Finally a relaxing weekend I’m looking forward to. This is the first year I’ve had Good Friday off for school, so I get to have my relaxing weekend finally. I’m working on getting my motivation for getting fit back up and my flailing grades have encouraged me to step back up to the plate with school.

"Today I'm celebrating by over-eating the peppermints from my can, because I know that if I save them up, I'll end up losing 10 at the at the dirty bottom of my bag when the can opens.

"Any hoodie-lovers out there find it hard to wear sweaters with no hood? I hope I’m not the only one, but I find it kinda difficult to get myself to wear a basic sweater. I usually wear pullover hoodies or if it’s really cold, a coat with a hood. But I seldom go outside without a hood. A hood is like a mooring for me; kinda makes me feel safe. What if it rains? Bad hair day? Ears feel cold? Mood swing and I don’t feel like talking to anybody?   It really sucks because I want to wear regular sweaters with no hood. I feel like it makes me look a little cleaner. I’ve worn a sweater and hat before, but it just doesn’t feel the same. Can anyone else relate?"	cc

"What did you do today and what are you planning to do tomorrow? (If it's morning where you are, switch that to what did you do yesterday and what are you planning to do tomorrow.)  It's 4:30 AM here and I've barely slept because I was reading creepy stories. I've pretty much accepted that, so now I'm just going to wait it out. Yesterday I was writing an essay on the history of slavery in New Orleans. (It's actually a really interesting topic- slavery was very different there than in other parts of the USA.) But you probably don't want to hear about that. I'm just bored and want to hear random stories about people's lives."	cc
"I think I can actually feel my depression lifting! I just wanted to share that after about 6 years of deep depression that saw me lose my friends, my family relationships and even my job, I feel better for the first time. I've noticed recently that I've been thinking about my future, managing finances, even shopping for new clothes (still online, but it's a start).   Yesterday I started to listen to music again; music I used to listen to and sing along with, I listened to and sang along with last night!  I have also noticed that I can articulate my thoughts better and I even had a normal dream Friday night. My cats are cuter, days are nicer (though I'm still locked inside). Everything just has a brighter sheen to it.  It's not great yet, but I hope it continues. I've needed to move for my new job for months but haven't had the will. I feel like I might be ready to make a change that I've wanted to make for years. I don't know how this is happening, but it is!  I'm sharing it here because I don't really have anyone in my life anymore, especially anyone who knows this side of me and would understand how fucking huge this is. Hopefully one day that will change!  Thanks for listening!"	cc

"I'm just so done I've been thinking about how I'll finally do it all night, I can't stop.  My life sucks, I'm 27 and have never been with anyone, ever. I'm probably the most unattractive woman ever actually, it's sad but it's something I've accepted. The one thing that gets to me more is how in my entire life, I've never really had friends either. Maybe in grade school but nothing irl since. How fucking sad is that? It's my fault too because I have so much social anxiety I can't even pretend to be a normal human. I did manage to make a few online friends last year but even then I do not fit in. They are really nice and normal while I am a shitty person who can't even give any advice because I've never actually lived. Once they realize how actually awful i am I won't have them either, even though they know I don't belong.  Maybe I don't actually have a problem, maybe I've just wanted excuse to explain why I am the way I am. Maybe I don't have depression either. But for someone who thinks about dying all the time has to have something wrong with them. This can't just be who I am. I can't do this anymore.  I am so tired of dealing with myself and I am tired of everything. I'm tired of being alone and unable to connect with people, of not even being able to do adult things. I'm tired of looking in the mirror and seeing myself. I am tired of going to work at my awful job, and I am just tired of waking up every single damn day.  Thanks for reading if you did. I figured it out and just need the courage now."	sw

"Do you ever get in the car with a friend and the worst possible song comes on? I was thinking about this because I keep my radio set to an old-school hip-hop station, but every time my cousin is in the car, some wild/embarassing songs come on.

It only happens with him, nobody else."	cc

"Dramatic songs that starts off slow and then builds up to an emotional climax I'm really not sure if this topic is allowed in this sub but I'll post it anyway. I've been compiling a list full of songs as this and I've been looking to add them more as time goes by. Personally these type of songs, no matter what genre, are my favorites. Themes of songs are usually very emotional and are rather long, like 5-8 minutes. I'm looking for other songs like this that you may know of, preferably indie rock, but any genre are welcome. Examples of songs that I'm talking about are;  - [Spanish Sahara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYoINidnLRQ) by Foals; intensity of Greek myth and haunting of families and generations  - [Lifeforms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcR1ut6FKYc) by Daughter; thoughts of a pregnant woman including breakups, infidelity and abortion  - [Transatlanticsm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3b6hDCIeDk) by Death Cab for Cutie; about two lovers in a long distance relationship   - [Limousine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V6mUFUwBGc) by Brand New; true story of a young girl killed by drunk driving  - [Future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oScRBsOV6I) by Paramore; starts of with an acoustic guitar before transitioning to heavy metal-like guitar riffs and heavy drumming (mostly instrumental)  - [Wait](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAwYodrBr2Q) by M83; about life in general  - [Black Flies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NPA__ra9uY) by Ben Howard; seperation of two best friends and moving on in life "	cc
"Weird dream-reality moments I had a moment today where I was working on an assignment for school and one of my classmates had already made index pages to go with the assignment and was sharing them with people.

"I'm going to kill myself I'm 23, male, only child, I live in a post-soviet country. I've been severely depressed for the past five years and I think I've reached my limit. I live alone with my mother, my dad was an alcoholic and he left when I was 3 years old, haven't seen him since. I've changed schools a lot, which left me with no real friends, I've been bullied a lot, I stayed at home pretty much all the time. I've started drinking in my early teens. In 2011 I got into a university, chose a profession that I hated, because it would bring money. In 2013 my grandmother had a stroke and ended up going full vegetable, we had to take turns with my mom, staying up all day taking care of her, because we couldn't leave her in a hospital. Cleaning, feeding through a tube, turning her around, all that. During that time I couldn't focus on studying, especially considering that I hated the subjects in the first place. I had to find a job, which left me with little to no time. My girlfriend, the only person I was talking to at the time, broke up with me because we just couldn't spend time together. Then after two years in 2015 my grandad was diagnosed with stomach cancer. He had an operation and ended up in a similar state, so now we had two people to take care of. Grandmother was fading at a rapid pace. My mother was working too and she was losing it. One time, when we visited grandad in cancer hospital she was screaming at people, crying and then she told me that she wanted to die. I had to stay strong during all of this, which I did. They both died in a span of two weeks, during my finals. I had to run all the burial-related stuff, going back and forth between the university and the cemetery. Since then I've found a job, which I quit after a year, because I hated it. Now I live in a country with african-level economy, I have no relatives except for my mother, no gf, no friends, no hobbies, a degree in a field that I hate, mild alcohol and drug problems, mild health problems and a long-lasting existential crisis. I have to mention that I am considering suicide not because I'm sad at the moment. I am calm and this is more of a rational choice. What would you recommend I do?"	sw
"I just don’t want to feel nothing anymore. I’m a 13 year old middle school student. My family is neither going through or has gone through hard times.  I don’t have severe anxiety or depression. I have never taken medicine in my life.  I am a middle class citizen with a house in the suburbs of Colorado. I have everything I could possibly need, and most things that I want.  I have zero friends and really the only people I talk to are my parents, which I suppose is part of the problem.  I write stories and post them online where people can read them. I’m part of several video game communities, and play many video games.  The issue here is the one people always neglect to see when they say that I’m privileged.  I feel completely empty inside. Void of most emotion besides boredom and tiredness.  When my parents yell at me for doing something wrong, I don’t feel sad or regretful, neither angry or pissed off.  This started a couple years ago, when I was about 10.  It’s gotten to the point where I now have to fake emotions like happy, excited, or sad. I taught myself how to cry whenever I needed to.  When my grandma died around New Years last year, I still felt nothing even though I was close to her.  I’m not completely sure what to do about it. I’ve had thoughts of suicide, but have never had to chance to go through with my plans.  At one point in my life I tried to hang myself off of my closet, but the bar snapped before I could end it.  I also had previous issues with cutting. I still have the scars on my legs, and they refuse to go away. They are a constant reminder of my both ignorance and selfishness.  I’m a privileged white bitch with everything I could possibly want, need, anything. I just don’t think anyone will really understand how I feel.  I’ve posted this online before, and got called an attention whore and a disgrace to humanity.   I really don’t think I can handle this anymore, but I’m to much a fucking coward to end it."	sw

"Went on a hike today (#87) My dad's old college buddy likes to go on hikes and he sends out mass invites to people about every other month to join him. I always was interested in going on a hike so back in November my dad asked me to tag along at it was fun. He did the same for today and it was again fun and quite an adventure.  Two other people who showed up last time (excluding me, my dad, and his friend) were there today as were three different people. My dad's friend and the one lady who showed up both times bring their dogs along (he owns a fat dachshund named Ella and she owns a golden retriever named Koby). Except for crossing a couple of water creeks, Ella is able to do the entire hike by herself despite her size and stumpy legs. Koby runs back and forth over and over and over and he often lays in puddles/water or rolls around in dirt. They make the hikes so much more fun.  We actually got lost today somehow. Apparently this crew often crosses from path to path instead of staying on the same one all the time (cause they always go to the same park so it'd get boring doing it that way) and when we switched to one path, even though we all thought there was only one possible direction to go, we went the wrong way. We managed to find our way back and eventually got to the cars. The hike started at 10am and (including a few short breaks and a far too long lunch break) we finished at 6pm. We apparently did around 6.5 miles according to one of the guy's hiking app. A lot of it was uphill but that's not much of a problem.  I haven't run much at all the past few months so my cardio is kinda shit right now (screw treadmills even though I'm in the gym 3-4 times a week) so it was a bit tiring at some points, but I could have kept going for much longer I felt. Or at least without the breaks. But since everyone else in the hiking group is somewhere between their mid-30s to late-50s, not everyone was as energetic as I was. My dad's friend has two bad knees and so when the painkillers wore off he really needed to rest more and more.   When I actually have free time when the semester ends to get a life, I would like sign up for hikes using the MeetUp app so I could hopefully hike with people more around my age (since I can't really find any of my own friends who'd be interested) because hiking definitely is a fun thing to do. I love the outdoors.  Do you ever do activities with your parents for fun? (or did you back when you lived at home if you don't anymore)  What are your thoughts on hiking?

I got talking to a bloke on a plane journey about what I'm doing with my life and he gave me some really sound advice about my situation and wrote me out some notes about my positive traits and all the things that I could and should do.  Simply the fact that a complete stranger took the time just to be a really genuine person has made my year. For the first time since quitting uni, I am genuinely excited to have no idea what I plan on doing with my life yet.

"Who should get the parking spot in a lot if the driver in front passed the spot and then tries to back up? I was in a crowded lot today hunting for parking. I was trailing behind a guy and he went right past an open spot without noticing it. I took the spot just as he hit the brakes and threw it in reverse to try to grab it.  He got out of the car and we got in a heated debate about who had rights to the spot. He argued that he had dibs because he entered the lot first. I argued that he lost his place in line as soon as he passed the spot. I ended up just giving it to him, meaning I got back in my car and backed out of the spot. Not because he was right, but because I just didn’t want to get my car keyed.  I’m still pretty salty about it. Who was right?"	cc

"Have you ever had any memorable teachers? Yesterday, I was really stressed out from being in one of my classes. During this class, it’s basically a built in work time where you’re meant to work on homework and whatnot. But basically, the people in my class, I cannot stand, and yesterday I couldn’t take it any more. I felt so small and unwanted in that class. So much so I left it crying. So come today, I asked my choir director if I could stay in the choir room instead of going to my normal class. While explaining why, I broke down into tears. She was so supportive though. She wrote me a pass to leave that class and so today I spent that time alone in the choir room, where it was just nice and quiet for once. My director had told me that I could come any time and to just ask for a pass from her. I’ve never really been close with any of my teachers, but she’s honestly so supportive in every way. She’s also inspired me to pursue a career in choral directing because she’s made such a big impact on me, and I want to be able to have the same impact on others. I’m just so appreciative to consistently have her support.   Anyways, have you had any teachers that impacted you in any way? "	cc

The easiest solution is to factory reset it.  But then I'm afraid of deleting any precious files that I somehow forget to back up, and erasing all the settings that are configured just how I like. The thought brings me physical anxiety.  Hopefully I can overcome this before I absolutely need a windows machine. All of this sounds incredibly petty now that I'm rereading it, but no harm in submitting anyway I guess."	cc
I just tried to turn the water to my faucet off using a light switch I was washing tri tip juices off of my hands and then moved to the light switch to turn the water off. I was on autopilot but I don't understand why my brain thought that the light switch would turn the water off. Any idea why I did this? and do you people have any experiences doing things that are similar to this?	cc
"Last day of the week for me This week has been different, but in that way the same.

"We are both bored so let’s talk about NyQuil dreams. (It’s a long one, buckle up) Flu season has been a real bitch this year. I got the same sickness twice, both lasting a week and a half. We all know the best way to escape being sick...that’s right people, that sweet green or red shot of NyQuil to send you into a deep sleep because everyone knows it’s hard to be sick when you are in a coma!   Here’s the kicker. Everytime I drink this powerful nectar, I have the weirdest dreams and I mean weiiiirrrddd people. Quick example: I dreamt I was going on a fun run in China but forgot my passport so I told them I invented fruit loops and they simply let me in the plane! This is simply absurd, fruit loops are awful (pardon my take) if it was Cinnamon Toast Crunch oh for sure let me in but Toucan Sam isn’t enough.  Thank you for taking time out your day to actually make it this far! I commend you for not opening and seeing the length and switch subreddits. Feel free to leave your weird dreams people, I know I’m not alone."	cc

"I wish I could change careers Why is it so hard to plan and think of a way to successfully change careers??   For me I just want to default and say it's because I didn't go to college... but education isn't really the issue. I just don't know how to go about changing it up without making a bad move that I can't recover from. I guess it's just the uncertainty of it all.  I have just about 10 years of industry specific background now in Federal Gov't Contracting. I started in finance and went from administrative assistant to AR Specialist to AP/AR Specialist to Asst. Controller (SB subdivision), Project Admin, and now Contracts Manager. No formal training on these things.. on the job training or I just figured it out.  I got laid off 3 years ago and took the opportunity to start fresh - moved away from a major contracting area and started working restaurant jobs until I figured out what I wanted to do. I was loving it, but it was hemorrhaging money. There were so few gov't contractors in the area... I got an offer within a few months without applying through linkedin... accepted and with them went from 37.5k to 50k in a year and a half. Now, I don't really have much beyond yearly COLA to increase my income unless we are awarded a large contract.   I just feel stuck here because I can't find different career & industry that will keep me whole while I transition to it and get up to speed.  I've got a house note and a lovely fiance.. my car is paid off. I just get no fulfillment out my work.  Have any of y'all gone through a similar phase? What worked and what didn't?    "	cc

For me, it's mostly popular stuff, like sports (minus sports entertainment), cars, fashion, music and pop culture.

"I never understood the whole ""anti college anti high school"" attitude of reddit So many people on here talk about how much of a waste of time it is to spend money on college and how useless high school is and that going straight to work or going straight to trade school or something is better. I personally never understood this attitude. I mean yeah college is expensive and going straight to work is financially wise af but theres just so many experiences to have and things to learn about yourself and the world that going straight to work will never help you with.             Going to college and learning about a wide array of topics from some of the smartest people in their fields is truly something that can't be experienced anywhere else. On top of that most people who graduate high school are 17-18 have a hunch about what they want to study but it's never really 100 percent certainty for the average person. there's still so much more to learn about the people around you and how they interact with each other outside of the work environment and just in general what different kinds of people are like i feel like an extra 2-4 years outside of high school should be there just for people to travel and meet people and learn stuff outside of their career interests just to develop more as a person and be happy with life and have memories you fondly look back on.

"Obsessed with my weakness after being beat up by a girl I'm a 19 year old man, my little sister is 11. I had to look after her. I'm formely anorexic, 6'1 and 102 lbs. She's something like 4'10 and 95 lbs.  Anyway, I kept pulling her hair to mess with her, I kept doing it because she was getting really angry and it was funny. It got to the point where she threatened to beat me up if I did it again. I inevitably did it again and she pinned me, telling me to apologise. This went on for like 20 minutes and my arms didn't leave the floor for the whole time. I eventually apologised to her and she kept milking the apology (telling me to say it louder because she ""couldn't hear me"") until I was really embarrassed.  Not proud of this but when she let go, I stomped on her phone on the ground cracking the screen. She then wrapped her thighs around my waist and squeezed until I was submitting. She wouldn't let go and I threw up on the carpet.  I'm getting really insecure about my strength now. It felt like she had an insane amount of leg muscle. We've done body measurements before and her calves are larger than my thighs when tensed and her thighs are only a few inches off my waist size lol. I chalked it up to her being fat but storing it in her leg area. I'm not sure anymore. Here's some pics, is it muscle or fat? How much stronger is she? A lot, a little?  Her: https://imgur.com/a/mdEpJ  Me: https://imgur.com/a/1zeoI  My therapist says I'm not ready to go to the gym, I'm having really negative thoughts rn. I know this will come off as sexist, but I really hate the idea of a girl being stronger than me especially a child. Idk what to do, I'm paying for her phone replacement and she said she wants some really expensive phone (costs 4 times the amount as her old one) and she threatened to beat me up again if I didn't get it (I wanted to buy a cheaper one). I ordered it and now she's treating me like her bitch. The whole thing is just so typically pathetic of me, I'm really considering just driving into a tree tbh lol. I always knew I was weak from anorexia, but she's a girl... and a child."	sw
"drunken idiot bad self hatred Got real drunk and made an ass of myself infront of work crew, even fell over at one point. Ran around with my shirt open, pants half unbuttoned. Although I did bump into a sober mate who saw and said I was just having a ""good time"".  Sprayed my beer on or near someone in a mock jerking off motion, and acted a bit silly cause even though she’s flirted with me before she’s not into me and was kissing another dude right infront of me, its almost as if she did it on purpose because she grabbed the guy by the hand, moved him and made sure it was in my vision before she started up, maybe not though.  I’ve spoken to some people who said who cares we all get silly sometimes especially working in bars like we do, but I’m older and acted like a teenager.  Saw her sister at work and got a bit of a funny greeting at first but it seemed to smooth over and go back to normal by the end of the night. We all work in hospitality and crazy shit it common place, from married guys getting drunk and hooking up with staff and then going home to their wives like nothing happened. I actually still remember my first staff party, people were so wasted on ecstasy the girls started giving the guys foot massages and sucking on their toes (I was just a shocked 19 year old kid watching it all)    I spoke to my workmate and he didn’t even know about anything happening and no one cares, but I always over react about stuff. Perhaps it will just blow over, none of the managers have called me in for a meeting or anything to discuss, and I realised the next day I didn't even really like that girl, it was just a nuts situation. I guess I'm just wanting to vent, as Ive been going in and out of panic attacks and anxiety, I even considered walking up to my manager and telling him I have to quit and find a new job.   I just hate myself for what i've done and feel like such a fool, haven't slept properly and have been drinking to try to forget and have had many anxiety attacks too in the process."	sw
"I'm not sure what to do at this point. I keep falling back into the same patterns of addiction, depression and all the shit that comes with it,  the one thing that keeps me from going completely psycho is music, I guess that's how I've made it through one and a half semesters in college somehow and work. It's been losing its luster though I suppose. It was one of the only things I had left. I had a guy I was chatting with here from this sub, I'm pretty sure he took his life like I was planning to do, it was sobering in a way I guess. Realizing just how fragile life really can be and how quick it can be gone, not a day goes by where I don't blame myself for it. He was making plans to move to FL to help a friend out with a restaurant. He originally wanted to move to Hawaii but his friend took presidence and I didn't get a message from him since late last year I've more or less given up on the possibility of hearing back from him. I dunno it's just all I can do to barely make it through the day and then stay up til 4 because everything haunts me, then get 4 hours of sleep waking up at 8 nearly every day. I've tried everything from sleeping pills to completely cutting caffeine out nothing works, it's just really starting to weight down on me more and more and more. Maybe this is a goodbye or maybe a hello to someone who needs help and advice more than I do, I can't tell."	sw
"I just can't fucking take it anymore.

He made me cope with my mother's death all alone and screamed at me for cheating after I got raped. All using the fact his mother never loved him as an excuse. All he fucking cares about is being able to tell people he knew in high school that he has a girlfriend so they don't think he's a complete loser. He never spends time with me. Right now he's in another country and keeps lying to me about coming to see me. He's pretending he's 30 minutes away from me because he thinks I'm stupid. Nobody else will ever care about me because I have a personality disorder that makes me fundamentally unloveable. I'm also fucking ugly, which even my partner admitted to recently.   I work a deadend nightshift job that's really hard on my body and live with someone who doesn't respect me and eats half of my food every week. I'm broke and my only family members who are still alive don't give a single shit about me. Everyone I love keeps fucking dying.   I have fucking no one. No therapy, no friends, no caring family, no loving partner. Absolutely nothing. I can't go to a hospital because I would lose my job and my life would suck even more.   I can't fucking take it anymore. I've known for years I was better off dead.

"I'm getting help, I have support, Why do I feel like this? Hi, I'm an 18 yr old latino male who have had suicidal ideations and thoughts of self harm since I was in 7th grade. I've had many lowpoints in my life including a point when I was 17 where I plunged a hair-dryer into a filled bathtub with me inside of it and it didn't electrocute me, I'm pretty sure it had something to do with the outlet I used inside the bathroom. I trusted my mother with my thoughts when I was young and she talked about it behind my back when she was with my father, discrediting it to me making excuses for my grades. I couldn't trust anyone anymore with my thoughts until I had flunked out of my number one school by isolating myself in my room for 2 months, ifinally told my parents the day before I planned to commit it, they helped me find a therapist and a psychatrist. Nevertheless I was hospitalized a month later for self harm, my parents were not sure I was safe and they work during the day, it was a particular bad day. Coming out of the hospital i felt a renewed sense of hope, I was feeling good, and ready to work on myself. Sinve then I have had tge most intense and vivid thoughts of killing myself and self harming. I've given in a few times and have cut up my face and hands, othertimes I talk to the many friends I have that are going through some of the same things. Lately I've been isolating myself from my friends and my parents have become frustrated with my lack of progress, I don't know what to do, I feel like its going to be any day now until I give into these thoughts that I have.I just don't know what to do, therapy is slightly working, but im not sure that it will be enough.

"My friend confessed she used to have suicidal thoughts So, as the title says, my best friend today confessed to me that about a year ago she used to have suicidal thoughts. It was during an argument and I didn't really get a chance to react to it at the time. But now that we've talked things out, I keep coming back to it and thinking if I shouldn't do something. She did tell me before that she is often under a lot of stress and she feels sometimes pretty down but this is the first time she mentioned suicide. And that makes me feel like it might have been a hint and I should ask her about it. However, she did say it was a year ago, at a time when we didn't know each other that well yet plus I know why she mentioned it now. So maybe it wasn't a hint. I know she doesn't really like to talk about serious things, so maybe I should just leave it be. Don't open any old wounds.

I honestly dont care what the future has for me, even if I imagine myself doing what i love i just feel...eh. Probably because I cant believe myself being happy or something like that.

"When people screen calls. (So this is also my first time posting into this subreddit so hello)   I’m sure it’s not just me who gets miffed about people screening calls and then texting right after “did you call?” Of course I did and you watched me call you.    As a person who doesn’t necessarily like talking on the phone, when I call it’s usually because it’s an emergency, urgent or I feel like I’m in danger.   I also hate the fact how text can’t translate emotions which can make things seem passive aggressive. Can you imagine if you were walking home and you felt like someone was following you and you tried to call your friend and they didn’t answer but immediately texted you after?  How annoying. Anyways don’t get me wrong I understand people get busy as well and with driving laws but even then it’s not hard to say “hey sorry I’m busy I’ll call you back”  I have a lot of older relatives and I love talking on the phone with them. I guess I just get impatient with people because when I call I’m trying to get ahold of them immediately and not waiting for them to text me back whenever they feel like it.   Am I just an impatient person or is texting really not that great?  Anyways I hope you all have a good day.   (EDIT: fixed a spelling problem)"	cc

"I cried I cried for the first time in 4 years. I thought I couldn't do that anymore, but they proved me wrong. My condition was becoming unbearable, so I tried to tell my parents that I was suffering, but they just told me to fuck off. They told me that I was just an attention seeking manipulative little shit, that I was terrible compared to my younger brother who is studying so hard for his tests right now, and that I should grow up. I'm trying my best not to fail at school with my assortment of mental disorders, and they refuse to listen to my cry for help. That pushed me over.   I just sobbed for thirty minutes straight on the floor. I just felt so overwhelmingly lonely. I forgot that my hands and feet tingled so much when I cried. I couldn't stand up, because I was out of breath, and my arms and legs felt weak. The thought of killing myself just felt so intensely comforting.   My hands are shaking right now, and my thoughts are a mess, but I just needed some place to vent, because I don't have any one to talk to about this. Everyones polite to me at school, but they don't really care about me. I live in the high school dorms, so my roommate's coming back soon, and he's going to be less than sympathetic if he sees me crying. Or anyone else in the dorms for that matter.   I'm sorry if you had to read this mess. It's night here, and I'm just so fucking tired. My assignments can wait. Not really, they're due tomorrow, but I don't care anymore. I'm going to bed."	sw
"Where is a good place to start anew? I think after having it on my mind for a couple months now, I want to start my life over again in a new town. For reference here, I have spent 22 years of my life in Virginia Beach, all to have never moved away from here. I feel like I am stuck in a rut in my life and I am finding it difficult to find new friends and move past memories that I have created in a city that I no longer wish to think about.  So, TL;DR: Where is a good city in the US to start fresh again that has a lot of potential for meeting new people and finding a good job. A place that I can call ""home"".   I will try to reply to all posts with genuine responses and will look into any place or anything suggested. "	cc

"Finally Learning French Again! I love the french language, so I have decided to learn french again! I learned it in school and I was actually pretty good at it; but unfortunately I've forgotten most of it.  But in time the desire to go to France and to live there became bigger and bigger each day, so I started to re-study the language a few days ago.  A little bit about myself: I'm Nabil, male, 19yrs old from germany! So, if you are french and interested in (voice-)chatting, hit me up! I'd love to chat with french people, that way I could improve my french skills even more :)"	cc
"It’s late, I’m bored, anyone else feel like they should be having an existential crisis but aren’t? I’ll be 37 in 4 days. I’m married with a 16 month old son who is my ride or die homie. We make enough to live comfortably and have money for retirement and emergencies. I don’t know if I just got over all of that nihilistic angsty bullshit for good or if it’s gonna smack me in the face one of these days. I feel like I’ve avoided tragedy for too long and it’s the thing that worries me most, but I can’t help but to think that I would still just have to be thankful with how good I’ve had it for so long.  This doesn’t have to be deep though. I like music and art and people. We can talk about anything. I’m not getting my hopes up for replies, just seeing if anyone wants to talk. Hmu."	cc
"What to do with a half-eaten box of Girl Scout Cookies? My parents sent us an Easter gift package, and inside there were a few gifts, including several boxes of Girl Scout Cookies.  Going through the box we realized that one of the boxes was open.  Chuckling to myself, as my mom loves to pack gifts inside unexpected boxes, I open it and..its an open package of Tagalongs, with several cookies missing.  Cracking up and assuming another family member must have munched on them, I eat one and put it aside.  Now I've come to find out that my parents had no idea the box was open and no one has fessed up.  We're not kids anymore, so this is the kind of thing that most of us would own up to with great bravado.    The box was packaged by my mom, and I find it unlikely that a UPS employee would open the box just to eat a few cookies.  I also think it unlikely that a Girl Scout would accidentally sell an opened box, but its possible!  My mom of course thinks I should toss them.  That sounds like a waste of cookies to me, and I've already had one besides.  What would you do?  And where do you think the cookies went?  Keep in mind not these are Little Brownie Bakers and not the locally sold and quite inferior ABC Bakers."	cc
"I’m so tired of not caring I need some help. I’ve been to a therapist, I’m on 40mg of prozac a day, but nothing is working. I have no reason to be depressed, my brain is just fucking stupid. I’ve got a family that loves me, a bunch of cool friends, a decent path to go forwards in my future, but I just don’t care.  Anything that used to interest me is just boring now. I can only concentrate on gaming for half an hour. I used to not be able to put a book down once I started, now it’s hard to finish a single page. I don’t feel terrible, per say, I just feel nothing. Excitement is gone from my life. I don’t know how much longer I can keep this up. It’s spring break ffs. Nothing to stress about, just a week of relaxing. I don’t care, though. Fuck man. I know there would be tons of people devastated if I died, but again, I don’t care. I mean, I’d be dead. Apathy fucking sucks. Help.  I’m going to bed. Hopefully I’ll be able to feel something in the morning."	sw

"Cant handle the stress I'm in a high stress program and I'm too mentally ill to handle it. I'm on meds but it's not good enough. I don't know what I was getting myself into. I can't handle the criticism without crying.  I'm also recently out as trans (female to male) and while everyone around me seems accepting, I feel like a joke. My parents also do not accept me for being this way.  How do I go home and not swallow all my pills and end up in a hospital bed like I have three times before? I don't have time for therapy and things aren't slowing down for awhile. I'd like someone to talk to who isn't my partner who wants to solve everything."	sw
"Peaceful way out, or unhappy life It's been years since I was normal or happy.  My goals were what kept me hopeful enough to keep my depression infrequent enough, but I only seem to have wasted time.  I moved due to health reasons, so all my friends are distant. And, I'm not gonna be a college grad any sooner than years.  Medications don't prevent me from getting mad at people in my head, and I'm living in a shelter. The only jobs I can get are low pay, and I don't have the luxury of believing in God.  I can't move back to my friends, because I'm living on disability support for mental illness. It only applies if I live here. I don't work well. Not for long.  Approaching or online dating doesn't work for me, either. So, I'm sorta stuck in this lonely poorness, where my head won't leave me alone.  Nothing quite brings me joy or take my mind off, either. I researched a painless and surefire suicide method, but live on in case I become rich through one my business plans. Then, I could start moving back, benefit the world, and improve my overall time spent."	sw
"Thank you, random girl from the store. You made my day! I live in a small town in Turkey. So today I went to a store nearby to buy some stuff, coke and milk and cookies and coated peanuts and things like that. When I got to the check out there were like six people queued, which is pretty impressive for such a small store. The cashier was a pretty and hard-working young woman, and she was doing her best to get all the items quickly so that people don't have to wait for long. Apparently she was working alone at that time.  I was the last customer in the line, but a young guy before me said, ""You go first, sir, I gotta get some other stuff."" I went before him and the girl immediately said her usual ""Welcome to our store!"" and started checking my stuff out. She enthusiastically asked whether I was interested in buying any of the things that were on sale today, with samples stacked right next to her, and I gladly picked some pudding. She said ""Thank you!"" and I replied ""Thank *you*"" with a smile.   And then she said something right out of the blue. ""Haven't seen you in a few days. Is it that you hadn't come here, or is it that I wasn't here when you did come?"" I was stumped. I didn't know what to say, so I just said, ""Really? I was here yesterday..."" (which I can't really remember.) And she replied, ""Yes I know you came here yesterday, but I mean before that, you know I haven't seen you in like four or five days.""  This is when my Turkish failed me and I just mumbled, ""Um.. I don't know really"" with a stupid smile, and then pretended to be busy bagging my stuff. She helped me bag them and before I left, I gave her a big, immensely grateful smile and said, ""Thank you very much"" and went home.  And now here I am telling you about it, because it really mattered to me. It mattered because someone who just randomly happens to work in a store nearby, actually missed me, noticed my absence. It mattered because she felt safe enough to ask me where I've been without worrying that I might respond in a rude or dismissive manner. It mattered because I genuinely believed that no one cared, and she, simply and elegantly and with just a simple exchange, proved me flatly wrong.  Thank you, random girl from the store. You rock!"	cc
"WTF Just Happaned So I'm working security outside, and there's no washrooms nearby and I need to pee. I get lucky and one of the construction guys comes back from something. I ask for him to just keep an eye out while I go use the washroom. I go over to he nearest Timmies and theres a line. I wait patiently, for my turn.  Just before it's my turn this guy(Mike) runs up to the washroom and hits the locked door. Before I can say anything the guy using the washroom opens the door and Mike pushes himself into the washroom. The other guy leaves, before Mike has a chance to close the door, I hold it open and explain its my turn. Now this is how I learn of mike's name.    "" Hey, I get you're waiting in line, but in these last 30 years have ever said hi to Mike?Ask him how he's doing""  I'm confused and perplexed, I look at the other men standing in line, and they are just confused as I am. As I turn back, Mike adds."" No huh, that's why I'm going to use the washroom, now if you'll let me.""  I sigh, and let go of the door.     What the hell did I just witness and experience?"	cc
"What do you think about flower tattoos on men? I've got one relatively small tattoo and I've been wanting to get more. I thought about getting an edelweiss tattooed on me somewhere, with a blend of watercolour too. The edelweiss was my mum's favourite flower.  I know what you decent folks would say: things like ""if you really like/want it, go for it and don't care about what other people think"". And that's what I'd say too.   But if you were being honest, what would you think if you saw some random dude with a small-ish tattoo of a flower with a bunch of watercolour blues around it? Is it too effeminate?"	cc
"Who needs friends anyway Well today I just lost all of my friends but one, because they're a bunch of circle-jerk  hypocrites. Shit went downhill after New Years Eve, two of my mates got drunk, one of which had alcohol poisoning. I helped one to his bed and checked on him frequently to make sure he didn't choke or anything, the other I helped for several hours making sure he didn't die or shit idk. First time this happened and I helped both of them.  From there on they hardly talked to me. No one ever asked how I was when I asked the question. Everyone stopped caring. A part of me wishes I never helped them and left them to fate.  One kept argoing me for no reason and the guy who constantly calls people a pussy or a cuck straight up tells me off for fuck all reason then blocks me. Dude contradicts himself all the time. Second 'friend' just sucks his dick off and follows his lead without even asking me what happened. Third kept sharing our dms with both of them.  The worst part about it was that we had this idea that we'd all live together in a big house with heaps of shit. Oh well, that's not happening any more.  I don't think I even have the capacity to have friends or make friends any more. It just keeps leading to heartache and bullshit.  I'm not sure how to feel :|"	sw

"No point anymore I feel like just ending it. whats the point? oh live on and continue to feel lonelly and numb my whole life? fun. I lie about how i feel to my family, i completely distanced myself from my friends. one of my friends texted me, saying she was worried about me. one. no one else cares.   i feel dirty and worthless, only being able to act right because of a damn pill. i cant cant any motivation for doing literallt anything other than sitting on my ass and doing nothing.   i shouldve killed myself in 8th grade, all the people i knew then went out of their way to make sure i knew i was no better than dirt. and they succeeded, you could literally torture me for hours and i couldnt tell you one fucking good thing about me. there isnt anything even slightly redeeming about me. im a fat, ugly, anti-social freak, with a broken brain. i feel bad for my parents for having a useless, embarassing son.
